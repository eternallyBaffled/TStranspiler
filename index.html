    This is an experimental implementation of the tablesmith logic in javascript. We use ohm to reproduce the syntax and try to parse all "official" tables.
    First goal is to be able to parse correctly. Second step would be to recreate the same results. This is complicated by the fact that tablesmith can not
    be run in commandline mode, so automatic comparisons are harder than they could be.
