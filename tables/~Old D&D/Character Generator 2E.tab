# Not everything you see generated here MUST be used.  The best way to use
# this table is to generate ONE (1) character at a time and try NOT to reroll
# any individual things.

############################## - B U G S - AND - NOTES - ##############################
# 1. Obviously, if something doesn't make sense, reroll it.
# Evil kids aren't going to be idolized by their "good/holy" parents.
# If something doesn't initially make sense, ask yourself "why (whatever)?".
# For example:  A "below average kid" is "respected" by his parents.
# Why?  Maybe because he/she can't help being below average (in school
# for example), but they never give up, so their relatives and parents
# respect that.
#
# Be creative enough and almost any situation generated here is possible. 
# Maybe the "evil kid" from the first example is idolized by his parents for
# giving up his "evil" ways despite some very (personally) beneficial reason 
# not to, like turning down a dragon's horde of gold to do something good
# with his/her life...maybe the parents secretly doubt they would have had
# the strength to do something like that.
#
# 2. Changing the father or mother histories can have buggy consequences.
# Example: For example- extra fame: "died when "PcName" was an infant. of
# minor fame..."
# Note the period after "infant" in the above sentence.  The way this is set
# up, there should be an occupation before "of minor fame...".  Somehow that
# gets skipped when you change the mother/father alive/dead part of the
# history after messing with occupations, character classes they might have
# been, fame levels they might have had, etc.
#
# 3. Percent signs (%) can't be used with numbers and be shown on the HTML
# side of Tabelsmith without using a special formatting (using "/%", a
# forward slash before the %).  However, using the correct format for
# displaying a % will create errors about 50% of the time.  Tablesmith sees
# the "/%" and looks for a variable named "/" which it doesn't find.
# Assigning the value of "%" to the variable "/" creates more errors.
# Using "//%" will _sometimes_ show the correct "%" symbol and sometimes show
# "/%", but at least the program doesn't error out.  For simplicity, I just
# spelled out "percent".
#
# 4. Racial Ability score modifiers are not figured into the stats.  They
# are:
#	Human: None		Elf: Dex+1, Con-1		Half-elf: None
#	Dwarf: Con+1, Cha-1	Halfling: Dex+1, Str-1 Gnome: Int+1, Wis-1
#
# I can probably fix that by using variables for determining the stats...
#
# 5. Changing your race does not change your Racial Ability Modifiers listed
# on the page.

# Note that most DM's would probably want the murderers to be alive when the character starts
# his or her career as the murderer can be used against the player at some point (DM's choice).
# For this reason, there is no option for escape and recapture happening more than 1 year later.
# 12 months after the escape could also be the first day of the character's adventuring carreer
# and the first adventure could be the capturing of said murderer.
