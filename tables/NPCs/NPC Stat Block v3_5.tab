# Updated by Larry Cormier March 3, 2006
#    Added D&D Non-Standard Point Buy Method for Attribute Generation
#
# Modified by Valminder, March 2006.
#    Adapted for TSv5.
#    I changed the "START" line.
#    Removed the "GenerateFeats" subtable and created "Random Feats.tab"
#    Removed the "GenerateSkills" subtable and created "Random Skills.tab"
#    Added links to:
#       Random Feats.tab
#       Random Skills.tab
#    Changed "GroupFlag", "PointBuyFlag", "DescriptionFlag" and "PersonalHistoryFlag"
#       parameters to reflect the standard 1=Yes 2=No
#
# Modified by Valminder, July 2006.
#    Fixed the point buy method.
#    Modified "AssignAbilities" to assign the abilities as per the class.
#    Added parameter to choose between "Core Gods" and "Religion.tab".
#    Added link to:
#       Background.Sorcery(%Gender%)
#       Religion.tab (replaced from "Random Deity.tab").
#
# Modified by Larry Cormier December 24, 2007
#    Addressed a Formatting issue that was associated with the Sorcery Background coding that inadvertently
#       changed the Gender of Male Sorcerers to Female in the Sorcery Background, itself. This was
#       accomplished by changing some Variable names (Gender2 to NPC_Gender), and adding a PC_Gender variable
#       that consequentially made the Variable references a little more easy to understand as well - especially
#       when other individuals are being referred to grammatically in the table... such as friends, relatives,
#       mentors, and enemies
#    Removed Exterraneous 'Sorcery Background' Coding that was overlooked when the Table had originally been
#       updated to Reference a link to Background.Sorcery.tab, as noted above.
#    Disabled 'Catonia' as a valid Insanity - after all, what good is a Catatonic PC - or NPC for that matter?
#    Added the potential for the PC, NPC, or Group Leader generated to have re-rollable Villainous Motivations
#       if so desired.
#
# Modified by Valminder, Jan 2008.
#    Changed Villain to Villain (and Villainous to Villainous) everywhere.
#    Removed some LN.
#    Corrected an error.
#    Removed all references to "Villainous Motivations" and linked to the "Villainous Motivations" table.
#
# Modified by Larry Cormier March 15-16, 2008
#    Addressed a few display issues that annoyed me; Especially NPC Stat Block Building Code to assure consistency
#    between NPC Stats and Animal Companions Stats, and 'everything' being displayed as Italics after a certain point.
#    Added BAB/Grapple determination table, as well as Space/Reach, and modified table to show'Full Attack' as the
#    Primary Attack Option display.
#    Replaced missing reference to include Melee Attack Bonuses Tables in Weapon Damage Displays.
#    Modified Ranged Attack Weapon Stats to reflect the Potential of additional Damage (Strength Modifiers) for
#    some Hand-Thrown Weapons, as well as Strength Modifiers for Composite Short and Long Bows, and additional
#    accuracy damage (Dexterity Modifiers) for Whips.
#
# Modified by Larry Cormier March 29, 2008
#    Fixed coding that erraneously designated Intelligence as the Prime Attribute for Sorcerers. It should have been
#    (and now is) Charisma.
#
# Modified by Valminder, Jan 2015.
#    Added Abilities modifier by Race 
#
# Modified by Valminder, July 2015.
#    Modified for "ENC Ultimate Random Encounter.tab"
#             parameters to add links to generate Description/History.
#    Added a "NPCLevel" parameter.
#          a "GroupFlagNumber" parameter.
#          a "LargeGroups" parameter.
#          "GenerateURE" subtable (for "ENC Ultimate Random Encounter.tab")

:Instructions
1,This table generates a Random, single class, 3.5E D&D Non-Player Characters (NPCs) or Player Characters (PCs) - complete with personality quirks and basic appearances in standard D&D Stat Block Format.<br>This update also randomly determines Paladin Mounts, Animal Companions for Druids and Rangers, and familiars for Wizard and Sorcerer NPCs.<br><br>You also have the option to generate a complete group of NPCs that can be used as Bandits, Pirates, Buccaneers, or other similar bands of adventurers that would typically run around together for Nefarious (or even Noble) purposes. It also provides a re-rollable option to make your NPC a Villain - complete with villainous motivations - if so desired. <br><br>
_Use this Table to generate quick, complete NPCs, Characters, or groups of opponents for your players - ready to Cut and Paste into any Game you may be writing - or as a quick way to actually begin to play D&D - as opposed to spending hours building a new character. All you have to do is select Race, Class, and Level as desired.<br><br>You can also generate completely random Characters (Level 1-20; standard Races and/or Classes) if desired.<br><br>
_Change the parameter (upper left-hand corner) to select your initial Gender, Race, Class, and Level Range to get started.

86-90,{Cap~[HeShe]} was raised as part of a Monastic Order
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?called/by the name of} [~Group Designer.StartMystic] that took [HisHer] family in.
_ They live a spartan existence, subsequently, so does [HisHer] family
91-95,Wealth is unimportant to [HimHer] and [HisHer] family. {Cap~[HisHer]} family's economic status is difficult to measure,
_ since they live a solitary life on the frontier as [SolitaryLifestyles], living entirely off the land
96-100,{Cap~[HeShe]} and [HisHer] family are dependents of the Military. {Cap~[HisHer]} [Relative] is an Officer, which means
_ little direct income - but the Military provides for all of their basic needs

:FamilySocialStanding
1-10,were considered Newcomers. {Cap~[HeShe]} and [HisHer] family were [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?settlers/refugees},
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?and their neighbors treated them accordingly/but they were treated as equals}
11-15,were treated poorly. Unfortunately, there were Members of [HisHer] family who were
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?guilty of/wrongly convicted of} crimes, so [HeShe] has been trying to rectify the situation ever since 
16-20,were Slaves. {Cap~[HisHer]} family were considered another person's property. {Cap~[HisHer]}
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?family were some of the lucky ones, since they lead pampered, if restricted lives/
_ were some of the unlucky ones, they were forced to do backbreaking manual labor for their 'Masters'}
21-45,were considered Lower Class. {Cap~[HisHer]} family were [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?laborers/servants}, and [HeShe]
_ has been struggling to escape that stigma nearly all of [HisHer] life
46-65,belonged to a Skilled [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?Trading/Merchant} family. {Cap~[HeShe]} was the child of
_ {AorAn~{CapEachWord~[Miscellaneous.Occupations]}}
66-75,|TempNumber={Dice~1d3}|was closely tied to {AorAn~[GroupAffiliation=%TempNumber%]} group by the name of
_ [GroupNameBranch=%TempNumber%] that was generally well regarded by the community
76-85,|TempNumber={Dice~1d3}|was closely tied to {AorAn~[GroupAffiliation=%TempNumber%]} group by the name of
_ [GroupNameBranch=%TempNumber%] that was generally despised and distrusted by the community
86-95,were considered Upper Class. They were the 'upper crust' of [HisHer] community
96-100,were Nobles, and [HisHer] family were at the very pinnacle of social standing in [HisHer] community

:FamilyDefenseReadiness
1-10,[HisHer] family proved to be very ineffectual in their defense of the family holdings. Essentially, [HisHer] family had
_ no cognizant ability to defend themselves - and were often berated as cowards, fools, or worse - but that was about all
_ that could be said about them
11-20,there was little to fear. {Cap~[HisHer]} family maintained a low, but effective level of readiness that included the use
_ of a few weapons and the discussion of how to defend themselves against raiders, or the occasional hostile monster
21-40,[HisHer] family were prepared - if necesary - for martial conflict. Most of [HisHer] family members were at least minimally
_ versed in the basics of using clubs, spears, and knives in self-defense and/or the defense of their home - but that was about all
41-55,[HisHer] family trained, and still trains actively in all matters martial. They can be prepared for combat with only
_ a few days of last-minute preparation
56-70,there was little need to fear. {Cap~[HeShe]} grew up in an environment where Combat was a regular part of the lives of
_ [HisHer] family, and most adult members of [HisHer] family were veterans of some type of combat.
_ Martial weapons and training were a regular component of their daily lives
71-80,there was little to fear since [HisHer] family has a tradition of military service, and family members are taught from birth
_ to be courageous and stalwart companions when battle is joined. The family armory has always contained magical weapons and armor,
_ and [HeShe] was taught the use of them all - almost before [HeShe] learned to walk
81-90,[HisHer] family relied upon outside protection such as guards or mercenaries. {Cap~[HeShe]} never had the need, nor desire
_ to prepare [HimHer]self for any potential conflict. {Cap~[HeShe]} was raised to leave any fighting that may crop up to the 'Pros'
91-95,[HisHer] family relied on magical protection, as opposed to 'Dirtying their hands'
_ with the base exercises associated with martial combat. It was a tactic that has proved quite effective for [HisHer] family
_ in the past - and it still seems to work. Their mantra: Don't try to fix it if it ain't broken. It could prove to be a
_ dangerous policy somewhere down the road, but for right now - it works
96-100,[HisHer] family really doesn't have any consistent pattern of preparedness should the need for martial expertise come into play.
_ Some members of the family were very prepared for combat, yet others were essentially unprepared - or merely unwilling to fight.
_ The Martial skills and/or Skill sets associated with each family member are specific to that particular family member

:FamilyPrivateEthics
1-25,considered themselves neutral, since they tended to exhibit [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?neutral ethics/no consistent
_ familial ethical direction of note} throughout [HisHer] early life
26-50,held to the letter of contracts and agreements, and could always be depended on to 'do the right thing' -
_ earning them a reputation for honesty and reliability
51-75,were known for their conscientious involvement in the community and their proactive nature when it came
_ to helping others
76-90,were often caught trying to [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?break agreements/recant on promises}
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?- although [HeShe], [HimHer]self, has been, and is still attempting
_ to 'turn over a new leaf' to rectify the situation/ - and unfortunately, [HeShe] seems to share the same traits}
91-100,would be considered undesirable - to say the least. They often took actions that could be
_ considered detrimental to the community [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?- although [HeShe], [HimHer]self, has been,
_ and is still attempting to 'turn over a new leaf' to rectify the situation/ - and unfortunately,
_ [HeShe] seems to share the same undesirable traits}

:FamilyPublicEthics
1-60,could be summed up as normal. {Cap~[HisHer]} family's ethical reputation matches their private ethics
61-75,could be summed up as undeserved. Clearly, the community has the wrong idea
76-90,has recently changed, however. Although the public perception about [HisHer] family has changed
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?for the better/for the worse}, the family's reputation has not yet been affected.
_ Interesting question: How did the policy change, and why? {Cap~[HeShe]} is intrigued by the policy change,
_ and is always willing to follow up any leads that may help answer those very questions
91-100,could be considered [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?beyond reproach/beneath contempt}.
_ Regardless of [HisHer] family's actual ethics, public opinion is so ingrained concerning [HisHer] family that
_ it's essentially unchangeable. In this case however, public opinion is [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?right/wrong}

:FamilyReligiousCommitment
1-20,could be considered [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?neutral/uninterested} since [HisHer] family had
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?no real commitment/an inconsistent} family religious direction as [HeShe] was growing up
21-40,were strong as [HeShe] was growing up. {Cap~[HisHer]} family was deeply committed to [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%]
_ as their patron Deity
41-60,leaned toward the worship of [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%] as their patron Deity for years, but they do not seem to
_ observe their religious commitments consistently
61-70,smack of enmity since [HisHer] family has had a historical conflict with the followers of [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%].
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?Although [HeShe] can understand her family's enmity, [HeShe] does not follow the same path/
_ {Cap~[HeShe]} shares her family's enmity, and carries the torch for yet one more generation} 
71-80,are participatory, as [HisHer] family is a part of a religious order dedicated to [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%].
_ |TempNumber={Dice~1d19}|{If~%TempNumber%<>1?Although [HeShe] can understand [HisHer] family's piety,
_ [HeShe] does not worship the same patron Deity/{Cap~[HeShe]} shares her family's beliefs, and carries the torch supporting
_ her family's religious convictions for at least one more generation}
81-85,smack of open Heresy. {Cap~[HisHer]} family believes in a religious movement considered
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?heretical/dangerous} by the community at large, and do little to hide their beliefs
86-90,lean towards hidden Heresy. {Cap~[HisHer]} family believes in a religious movement that is considered
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?heretical/dangerous} by the community at large, however, [HisHer] family attempts to hide
_ their commitment from the general public
91-100,could be considered mixed, since [HisHer] family openly venerates [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%]
_ while privately venerating [ChooseDeity=%CoreGods%]

:FamilyReputation
1-40,is essentially unknown, as [HisHer] family has no perceived character. Individuals are treated according to
_ the situation without any regard to the family name
41-55,is Good. {Cap~[HisHer]} family is known to produce stalwart companions, and they are always sought out when
_ dependability, or a reputation for steadfastness is desired
56-65,is outstanding. {Cap~[HisHer]} family is known to produce upstanding individuals,
_ but has also been known to produce the occasional bad apple
66-75,is generally well respected, although it has been known to produce a Black Sheep or two over the years.
_ In general, [HisHer] family is considered upstanding, but at least |TempNumber={Dice~1d4}|[NumberNames=%TempNumber%]
_ {If~%TempNumber%=1?member of the family is/members of the family are} known to be disreputable
76-90,is mostly bad. The family, in general is treated with contempt, but occasionally a family member or two has
_ demonstrated positive qualities and has earned the respect of those they have interacted with
91-100,is bad. Others treat [HisHer] family with contempt, and every member is assumed to be disreputable

:FamilyPoliticalViews
1-15,Apolitical. {Cap~[HisHer]} family has no specific political stance
16-30,Supportive. {Cap~[HisHer]} family supports the current political structure and the current rulers
31-40,Enfranchised. {Cap~[HisHer]} family is a part of the system and supports it as it is
41-45,Enfranchised Progressive. {Cap~[HisHer]} family is a part of the system, but is open to suggestions for change

_ overthrow [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?the political system/the existing rulers}
86-90,Radical. {Cap~[HisHer]} family is in open revolt against the current system and the existing rulers
91-100,Mixed. One part of [HisHer] family supports the current
_ [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?system/rulers},|Chance2=%Chance%|
_ and other factions are actively working to [Chanceof]{If~%Chance%>50?replace/remove}
_ {If~%Chance2%>50? that system/those rulers}
