# Chapter 4 - Random Name Generation
#

#
# The following collection of tables are used for random name generation based on a
# Race and a Gender. The gender is determined by a variable called %Gender% and needs
# to be set before calling the appropriate table. The [Race]Name tables will generate
# names according to the conventions for that race by calling a [Race]%Gender table
# and then possibly a [Race]Surname table. If you wish to generate a specific
# [Race]%Gender% name, you can call a table directly, such as BrandobianMale.
#

#
# Brandobian Name Generation
#
# If you wish to add more names, just add an entry at the end of the appropriate gender
# or surname table. All table entries are equally weighted, so just increase the
# generation number by one for each new entry.
