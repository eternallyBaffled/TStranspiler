# Character Background
#
# Table by Vance Reed. clubvance@comcast.net
#
# This table is designed to create character backgrounds
# for use in medieval fantasy role playing games.
#
# This table was created directly from
# "Central Casting: Heroes of Legend" by Task Force Games (First Edition)
# and parameters modified for use in my d20 campaign. The original work is
# still required for a full background and I highly recommend this work for
# character background in any fantasy setting.
# 
# You may either run this table in AUTOMATIC MODE and have TableSmith
#  make the necessary dice rolls, OR, thanks to the new TableSmith
#  commands, you may INPUT your own dice rolls in the MANUAL MODE.
# 
# Thanks again to Bruce for TableSmith and TFG for Central Casting
#
### Note to self: % can be displayed using &#37 or /% ###
### Note from Valminder: use &#37 in TSv5.
#
# Modified by Valminder, Feb 2006.
#    Adapted for TSv5.
#    Changed all /% to &#37
#    *** I adapted most of the table to TSv5, but it's still broken when
#        the Split~ function is used.

_This table is designed to create character backgrounds<br>
_for use in medieval fantasy role playing games.<br><br>
_This table was created directly from<br>
_<b>Central Casting: Heroes of Legend</b> by Task Force Games<br>
_and parameters modified for use in this program. This is not<br>
_meant as a substitute for purchasing the book, but as a<br>
_playing aid to suplement the book.<br><br>
_You may either run this table in AUTOMATIC MODE and have TableSmith<br>
_make the necessary dice rolls, OR, you may INPUT your own dice rolls<br>
_in the MANUAL MODE.<br><br>
_In MANUAL MODE, you may enter an 'r' for the program to roll a <br>
_Random number or an 'a' to Auto-complete the rest of the rolls<br>
_automatically. Just click on the parameter button in the upper left corner.<br><br>
_Note: Literacy checks are done 3 times during the background<br>
_generation. Once at the end of each phase of the character's life.<br><br>
_You also have the ability to racially adjust the age at which<br>
_events occur. To change the ages, you have to go into the Race<br>
_groups and adjust the age modifier.<br><br>
_Thanks again to Bruce for TableSmith and TFG for Central Casting<br>

:How I Use Skill Ranks
1,This is how I use skill ranks in MY D&D 3.5 campaign. You might like to do something similar.<br>
_<br>
_<b>Normal Skills: </b><br>
_Use them as if they were skill training points in your first player class EXCEPT apply the skills as a 
_BONUS instead of as a RANK. This way a low level character may actually be able to exceed what would normally be 
_the max skill "RANKS".
_A special case is Urban Survival and Wilderness Survival. If your campaign uses both as independant skills, 
_no changes are necessary. If you simply use "Survival", apply the bonus only in the proper situation.<br><br>
_<b>Weapon Skills:</b><br>
_I feel that directly applying Ranks as bonuses is too much for my campaign, so this is the way I handle it.<br><br>
_1) For the first Rank, a character gains basic proficiency in the weapon. This is good if the weapon is one that 
_is not usually proficient. This includes "exotic weapon proficiency" in THAT weapon if it falls into the exotic category. 
_If he is already proficient, go to step 2.<br>
_2) After the first point is used (if necessary) the character may "purchase" any of the following feats for 2 Ranks each 
_IF HE QUALIFIES for the feat. Feats apply to THAT specific type of weapon.<br>
_Weapon Focus<br>
_Weapon Finesse<br>
_Two Weapon Fighting (if it is a two-hand weapon)<br>
_Two Weapon Defense<br>
_Quickdraw<br>
_Point Blank Shot<br>
_Rapid Shot<br>
_Precise Shot<br>
_Rapid Reload (if a crossbow)<br>
_<b>These feats may only be used with the type of weapon indicated!</b><br>
_Example: Quickdraw may only be used with a longsword, not a shortsword or hammer.<br>
_3) IF there are still points left after purchasing at least one of the above feats, you may purchase EITHER +1 "to hit" 
_or +1 "to damage" for 2 ranks each.<br><br>
_Bret, the rogue ends up with 6 Ranks in rapier. He is already proficient, so skip step 1.<br>
_For step 2, he decides to "purchase" Weapon Finesse AND Weapon Focus for 4 Ranks. Weapon Finesse will only work for 
_him with a rapier, not with any other "light" weapon. With 2 Ranks left to spend, he goes to step 3.<br>
_Being a rogue with high DEX (and a little too sure of himself) he opts to purchase +1 damage. This applies to 
_any rapier he weilds.<br><br>
_You may like to modify how ranks apply in your campaign. This is just an example of how they are applied in mine.<br>
