1,burn ointment|Cost=25||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Cures 1d3 fire damage.|
1,carrot tonic |Cost=20||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=+2 Search and Spot for 1 hour.|
1,drypowder (½ pound)|Cost=30||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Powerful desiccant. ½ pound of this powder absorbs 1 gallon (a little more than 8 lb) of water forming a dry slurry that will not evaporate. You cannot get the water back out of the slurry unless you treat it with the appropriate alchemical procedure (DC 12; 1 sp of materials per gallon of water). 1 pound = 1d4 CON to oozes and water elementals with a ranged touch attack; or 2d4 CON if they can be made to consume it (no save in either case). Ingested-type poison to other creatures = Fort DC15 (1d3 CON/1d3 CON) but it cannot be successfully hidden in normal food or drink.|
1,duramaker|Cost=20||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Viscous silver-colored substance. +3 Hardness/+2 break DC when rubbed on any material (max 2x original hardness). DU = 1 hour. DOESN’T affect creatures of any kind. 1 dose = 1 square foot and affects a thickness of up to 8” of wood-bone;  4” of stone; 2” of metal.|
1,firesnuff|Cost=10||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Ashen powder. Automatically puts out a small fire (lit torch; small campfire) and alchemist’s fire. A character that is on fire can have his flames immediately extinguished if he or a companion casts a dose of firesnuff upon him. It can injure fire elementals (1d8 dmg; ranged touch attack). No effect on lava or magma based creatures; or ones that are merely hot rather than flaming.|
1,flamebane Salve|Cost=11||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Almond-scented salve. Fire Resistance 3 if pasted over your body.  Fire Resistance not cumulative. Full-round action to paste it over your body (AoO from opponents). DU = 1 hour (can be washed off). Automatically washes off if immersed in a liquid such as water. If immersed in hot liquid (boiling water; lava) Fire Resistance only for 1 round.|
1,glow chalk|Cost=25||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=This alchemical chalk makes it easy to read writings and markings in the dark. Markings made with glow chalk will glow indefinitely. It is especially useful to miners and adventurers to leave messages for each other or leave direction markings on dungeon walls - but this also makes it easy for monsters to follow you in the underdark. Glow chalk provides no useful amount of illumination.|
1,poisonbane unguent (web)|Cost=50||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Bluish-green colored cream made from various distilled and concentrated herbs known for their ability to counteract poisons. If it is smeared on poisoned wound you get 2 saves vs the poison’s secondary damage (instead of the usual one) and you may choose the better result.|
1,preservative balm (web)|Cost=10||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=A quantity of this rose-scented balm liberally applied to a dead body helps to preserve it. A Medium-sized creature requires one full jar. Other size creatures require proportionally more or less: Tiny = 1/16; Small = ¼;  Large = 4; Huge = 16. The body can last for 2 days longer than is described in the <i>raise dead</i> spell before the spell will no longer affect it. The balm must be applied within 1 day of death. Further applications have no additional effect.|
1,purifier drops (web)|Cost=50||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=One dose of this transparent liquid clears 1 gallon of water of all normal (non-magical and non-supernatural) diseases and poisons. It’s tasteless but it ruins the flavour of other drinks such as beer – wine – milk - juice. A character may sneak this into his own drink at a formal occasion with a DC 10 DEX or Sleight of Hands. When doing this under close observation this check is opposed by the observer’s Spot check.|
1,scentmuter snuff (web)|Cost=2||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Inhaling this mixture deadens your sense of smell for 1 hour. You become immune to scent-based effects such as skunk spray or a kuo-toa’s stench. The mixture is too fine to be used as a grenade-like weapon.|
1,scentmuter unguent (web)|Cost=5||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=By pasting this pale odourless cream over your body it removes all scent from you until it wears off in 1 hour. It does not wash off. The unguent renders you undetectable by creatures relying upon their sense of smell. It takes a full-round action to paste the unguent over a character’s entire body (AoO).|
2,smokestick|Cost=20||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=10' cube of <i>fog cloud</i>; wind can dissipate it.|
1,snappowder (web)|Cost=5||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=One dose of this semi-colorless powder covers 5’x5’. Any creature weighing more than 20 lbs that walks (slithers; crawls; etc) on it sets off these tiny harmless explosives with a snapping sound and a tiny flash of light. This effect lets you hear creatures sneaking up on you and see where a creature is moving even if it is invisible or concealed by normal darkness. Creatures standing perfectly still can’t be detected; but creatures in melee combat usually can. You can automatically locate the square where a moving creature is and the sparking trail it leaves allows you an additional reroll of the miss chance due to concealment. The strewn powder can be detected with a DC 18 Spot or Search check. It can be swept up without setting it off.|
2,sunrod|Cost=2||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=1' long gold-tipped iron rod; glows brightly 30' radius (shadow 60') for 6 hours.|
2,tanglefoot bag|Cost=50||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Throw bag of goo that bursts on impact to entangle creature; can glue to floor; can prevent winged creature from flying; can hinder a spellcaster (DC15 Concentration); lasts 2d4 rounds.|
1,thoughtfocus incense (web)|Cost=5||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Used by scholars to increase concentration. A stick of thoughtfocus incense burns for 1 hour; creating an invisible scent cloud 15’ in diameter. +1 competence bonus to Knowledge checks while breathing this incense. This bonus does not stack with other competence bonuses from any source.|
2,thunderstone|Cost=30||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Throw on floor/wall; when it strikes a hard surface it creates a deafening bang 10' radius; Fort DC15 or deafened 1 hour (-4 Initiative; 20 <b>percent</b> to miscast spells with "V".|
2,tindertwig|Cost=1||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Small wooden stick which ignites when struck; easy to make fire.|
# CITSC - Cityscape (WotC)
1,liquid light (CITSC)|Cost=25||Wt=0||Book=CITSC||descALCH=This viscous fluid is a bright yellow hue and glows faintly in the dark. A flask can be thrown as a splash weapon (PH 158; ranged touch attack; 10’ range increment). A direct hit imposes a -8 penalty on the target's Hide checks; anyone within 5’ is splashed and takes a -4 penalty. The paint glows for 1d4 hours. It can be washed off with soap and water (3d4 minutes).|
1,sewer mask (CITSC)|Cost=30||Wt=0||Book=CITSC||descALCH=This is a small fabric-and-leather mask that is worn over the nose and mouth. +5 circumstance on saves vs airborne disease; inhaled toxins; and nonmagical effects that cause the sickened or nauseated conditions. Each mask is good for 2 hours of use.|
# DR280 - Dragon Magazine

1,mercury or quicksilver|Cost=30||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=(Natural Element) Alchemists have long known about quicksilver; the silver-colored liquid that is liberated from the mineral cinnabar. The liquid does not flow like water but beads up and forms small puddles of silver liquid. Many alchemists have experimented with mercury and have learned that it can be used to determine temperature among other uses. While exposure to small amounts of mercury in the short term usually has no harmful effects; long-term and repeated exposure can lead to hazardous effects or even death. The ability to cause severe and permanent damage (even death) to its victims from very small amounts has made mercury a choice weapon for assassins. The assassin must be patient for mercury’s maximum effects to be noticed; but the beauty of mercury is that many times the true source of the poisoning is never known.-----Inhaling the fumes of a large quantity of mercury (greater than 10 gallons) results in nausea and abdominal pains. The victim must make a Fortitude save (DC 14) or be incapacitated for 1d6 rounds.-----Mercury is best used as a slow acting poison; it can be absorbed through the skin or ingested in food or drink. Over time mercury’s toxicity results in damage to the nervous system – heart – lungs – kidneys - brain. Long-term and repeated exposure to even small amounts (one drop) of mercury can result in permanent damage or death.-----For every week of exposure to at least one drop of mercury the GM should roll randomly for one of the following effect: 1-2 = 1 temp DEX; 3-4 = 1 temp CON; 5-6 = 1 temp INT.----- When damage to one ability score occurs three times (despite any healing that has occurred to that ability score) the character then takes 1 point of permanent damage in that ability.

1,nus (AQ)|Cost=300||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=(Al-Qadim) The name of a bush of the Crowded Sea from which a mundane potion of the same name is made granting its user the ability to breath water for 2 hours. The potion is rarely found away from the Crowded Sea and southern ports.|
1,poisonflesh draught (web)|descALCH=This bizarre and bitter-tasting alchemical solution allows a character to render his own flesh poisonous to creatures that bite him. When this draught is created it is mixed with an Injury or Ingested type of poison; it does not work with any other type of poison. A character that drinks this draught becomes poisonous. For 8 hours after consumption he is immune to the poison with which the draught was created. In addition his flesh contains that poison so anything that bites him or otherwise consumes his flesh or blood is exposed to and affected by that poison (if it fails its Fortitude saves).----------Ex: if a fighter drinks a poisonflesh draught of blue whinnis poison he becomes immune to blue whinnis for 8 hours. If during that time an animal bites him; it has effectively ingested a dose of blue whinnis poison and must make Fortitude saves to resist its effects. The character cannot use his own bodily materials (such as blood) to envenom his own weapons as the poison in his system degrades within a few minutes of leaving his body. The character cannot poison another creature by biting it.----------POISON = [Poisonflesh_Poison]||Cost*3||Wt=0||Book=1|
1,slick fire (web; Tuesday's Two-Pager)|Cost=100||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=This alchemical goo is rarely used because of its volatility in air. If covered by sufficient water this slippery substance can cause two very surprising and very different effects to anyone getting it on himself. Moving through a square with slick fire on it requires a Balance check (DC 20). Failure halts movement and failure by more than 5 causes a fall. Unaware characters automatically attempt to use the accelerated movement option under Balance (suffering an additional –5 penalty). The slick part of slick fire is only the beginning. When slick fire is removed from water it bursts into flame. Each patch of slick fire causes 1d4 Fire dmg. Standard action + Reflex save DC15 to put out one patch of fire. Failure (or no attempt) cause the patch to continue burning for 1d3 additional rounds. Anyone walking through slick fire gets one patch of it on his feet. Each time someone falls in the slick fire they gain an additional 1d3 patches somewhere else on their body.|
1,slowfall cloak (web)|Cost=100||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=Item useful to all adventurers especially ones without access to the <i>feather fall</i> spell. This billowing cloak is made of exceptionally light streamlined material and acts as a crude airfoil. If a falling character makes a DEX or Tumble check (DC 12) it reduces her falling damage as if she had fallen 10’ less than the actual distance. If the character deliberately jumps she can safely descend 20’ without harm if she makes a DEX or Tumble check of DC 10.|
# DR280 - Dragon Magazine
2,truth wine (elven) (DR280)|Cost=75||Wt=0||Book=DR280||descALCH=Sweet white wine. One glass (8 oz) loosens the tongue more effectively than other alcohol-based drinks. In addition to suffering the wine's normal intoxicating effects : <b>Will (DC 15) to tell a lie</b> (for 10 rounds -1/CON bonus). Elves are unaffected by truth wine.|
2,vapor's of sleep (DR280)|Cost=50||Wt=0||Book=DR280||descALCH=Applied to a cloth and held over the nose and mouth (or other breathing orifices) = Fort (DC 13) or sleep (as <i>sleep</i> spell for 1d4 hours). Must grapple the target to use this. Vial can also be thrown; direct hit = Fort(DC 13) or –2 circumstance on all actions due to drowsiness and disorientation for 1d4 rounds.|
# DR285 - Dragon Magazine
2,moonmoss pudding (halfling) (DR285)|Cost=150||Wt=0||Book=DR285||descALCH=Sweet fruity pudding - glows in the dark. Short-lived boost of energy for 1 hour = +4 alchemical bonus Initiative. Stays fresh for one day.|
# MoF - Magic of Faerun
1,smokepowder (1 oz; MoF)|Cost=16||Wt=0||Book=MoF||descALCH=(MAGICAL) This magic alchemical substance is similar to gunpowder. The substance burns rapidly but is not explosive (though it can be used to construct grenades and bombs). Burning smokepowder illuminates in 30’ radius. The fire lasts 1 round for every ounce of powder. It takes an ounce of smokepowder to shoot a firearm once. If smokepowder gets wet it never again burns and cannot ever be used to fire a bullet. Caster Level: 9th; Prerequisites: Craft Wondrous Item - 9+ ranks of Alchemy; Market Price: 16 gp; Weight:  1 lb.|
# Occult Lore
1,wyrm snare (OR; Occult Lore)|Cost=5980||Wt=0||Book=1||descALCH=5 onces of a liquid that looks like turgid urine and smells exactly like the musk from a dragon in heat. One five-ounce vial contains enough wyrm snare scent and pheromones to attract any dragon within 100 miles.<br>To use it: find a suitable location; place the bottle on the ground; uncork it; and then run like hell. Any dragon that picks up the scent from this concoction must make a Will save (DC 30) or become immediately drawn to it. Once within 60’ of the chemical it must make a second Will save (DC 40) or go into a mad mating frenzy looking for anything even remotely dragonlike with which to mate. Experienced; wealthy; and knowledgeable dragon hunters sometimes use wyrm snare to bring their prey to them; but in all honesty the chemical is probably as dangerous to them as it is to the dragon: a psychotic; raving mad dragon is more of a threat than one that has its wits about it; generally.<br>Wyrm snare loses its odour after a week and its pheromones after a month. (That means even though a regular creature can’t smell it dragons are still able to pick up on it for a full month.)|
# S&F - Scales and Fur
1,Mmliak's all-purpose adhesive (1 oz; S&F)|Cost=150||Wt=0||Book=S&F||descALCH=This sticky substance is a cheap but less efficient alternative for the sovereign glue. It is sold in a normal vial whose inside has been coated with a mixture of common oil and wine to prevent the adhesive from adhering to the container's interior. STR DC30 to separate objects bonded together. OTHER USES: A shield coated with it can fasten the weapons of opponents unless they succeed at a Reflex save (DC 15). In this case a DC15 STR check is required to pry it off. Combatants who pour the adhesive in their hands gain a +4 alchemical bonus to grapple checks. These and many other uses are possible but in most cases the user must be cautious to avoid bonding with the wrong surfaces.  1 OZ = 1 square foot of surface; DU 5 rounds.  Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive immediately provided that it is applied in the same quantity of the mimic adhesive.|
1,man-to-fish oil (S&F)|Cost=1200||Wt=0||Book=S&F||descALCH=When this viscous oil is rubbed around a creature's nose or mouth (standard action) it impedes normal respiration for the next 3 hours. The creature can breathe underwater instead but it suffocates in 2d6 minutes if removed from the water. A Fortitude save (DC 15) negates the oil's effect. The substance that makes this item is extracted from an aboleth's mucus cloud and is sold per ounce. It is considered an illegal item in most cities because it can kill someone easily.| 
# Tobril 6 - Dragonlance Magazine
1,acid -black dragon (Tobril6)|Cost=1500||Wt=0||Book=Tobril_6||descALCH=Can be thrown for 4d4 splash; a critical can hit eyes; damages also if ingested or inhaled.|
1,green dragon gas (Tobril_6)|Cost=3000||Wt=0||Book=Tobril_6||descALCH=Milked from the glands of young green dragons; this biochemical product reacts with air to produce a poisonous gas. If opened or smashed a typical dosage can create a 10’ radius cloud; 6d6 dmg to all who inhale it (Reflex ½ DC 16). A slain green dragon can produce one vial per age category but the allies of green dragons usually have access to living sources.|
