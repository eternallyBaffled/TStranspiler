# 00: The Fool
# The Fool is a quirky and variable character; he may be clad in the fool's cap and motley of a jester (or joker), or in gorgeous, elaborate, and
# costly (though not cumbersome) vestments. A staff and pouch over his shoulder, a little dog behind him, he strides blithely into the world. The
# Fool is often seen dancing at the brink of the precipice, for his is the folly (and the wisdom) of childhood, the innocence of the babe and the mis-
# chief of a child. 
# Upright, the Fool signifies unformed potential, the need to make choices and the necessity of
# making the right choice, the wisdom of fools and the follies of the wise. Drawer gains one more draw, but the new draw does not count unless the
# card drawn is one with an effect that is mostly good for the drawer. 
# Reversed, this card signifies thoughtless
# action, folly; choices must be made, but may well be faulty. Effect as above, but the subsequent card must be mostly bad in effect.

# 01: The Magician
# The Magician stands at a table on which are various articles: swords, wands, pentacles, cups, dice, balls, bells, or others. One hand
# holds a double-ended wand toward the heavens,the other points to the earth; over his head is a lemniscate curve, the symbol of eternity and
# infinity. The table, which resembles an altar, is surrounded by growing things. Represented here is the rational mind, confident in its power
# and right to use the forces of the infinite to reshape the world of matter. 
# Upright, The Magician signifies will, mastery, the ability to manipulate the universe through rational thought, self-confidence, 
# ability to manipulate others. Drawer gains one point of Intelligence, two points if a mage or specialty wizard.
# Reversed, this card signifies ineptitude, failure of will, indecision; abuse of power; disquiet; mental illness. Drawer loses one point of Intelli-
# gence, two points if a mage or specialty wizard.

# 02: The High Priestess
# The High Priestess sits enthroned in her temple, dressed in flowing robes that obscure a scroll or a book of secret laws and wisdom she holds
# securely. She is the mother of wisdom, sometimes identified with Isis or Diana; the queen-protector of hidden knowledge and occult
# mysteries.
# Upright, she signifies serene knowledge, sagacity, intuition, foresight, inspiration, the power of the inner mind to heal, create, enlighten,
# and inform. Drawer gains one point of Wisdom, two points if a cleric or priest. 
# Reversed, she signifies superficiality, conceit, shallowness, a lack of depth, perception, or understanding; an acceptance of external and
# superficial "knowledge," of trivialities. Drawer loses one point of Wisdom, two points if a priest or cleric; in the latter case, receives one new proficiency.

# 03: The Empress
# Royal and matronly, the Empress sits enthroned among rich fields, clad in opulent garments, and crowned with a starry, open crown. Befitting her
# position, she bears a scepter, for hers is the realm of universal fecundity and wealth.
# Upright, she signifies material wealth, productivity for farmers and creative workers, profitability for merchants, practical application of
# knowledge. The next time treasures are divided, the drawer will receive some item which turns out to be worth an extra 3d6(x.l ,000) gp; but even the
# drawer will not notice until at least three days later.
# Reversed, she signifies poverty, sterility, inability to produce; waste or dissipation of resources. The next time treasures are divided,
# the drawer will receive an item which proves to be worthless (a seemingly magical mace which actually has Nystul's magic aura on it, or a
# "ruby " which is actually cut glass, and so on) as the largest part of a treasure share, but will not notice for at least three days,

# 04: The Emperor
# Regal and fatherly, the Emperor sits upon his throne, with open spaces surrounding him for a domain. He wears royal robes, and in his hands
# bears a scepter and an orb of rulership. His crown is simple but majestic. He is the active principle, the ruler of the visible, material world through law.
# Upright, he signifies leadership, strength of mind, dominance, law, control of natural drives, stability, power, conviction, and protection. A
# lawful drawer gains two points of Charisma; a chaotic drawer must successfully save vs. poison or suffer confusion for 2d4 months; a neutral
# drawer is unaffected.
# Reversed, he signifies immaturity, confusion or loss of control, ineffectiveness, irrationality, attempts to destroy one's authority or rights.
# Unless the drawer saves vs. death magic at -4 (-2 for neutrals, no penalty for chaotics), over the next four days, the PC gradually goes insane in
# one of the following "ways, becoming: manicdepressive, schizoid, demented (dementia praecox), or hebephrenic.

# 05: The Hierophant
# Established in state within his temple, the Hierophant is the embodiment of the church in the world, the external pomp and ceremony of orga-
# nized religion; his elaborate crown, ornate robes, and scepter of power establish him as a hierarch and a potentate. He is the link between deity and
# worshiper, his is the role of mediator and medium. As the High Priestess is mistress of the hidden mysteries, the Hierophant is the master of exter-
# nal, manifest religion, law, and morality, usually depicted ministering to, or being attended by, two lesser priests, upon whom he bestows a blessing.
# Upright, the Hierophant signifies the outer form of religion; social relations with the world; ritualism; conformity, traditionalism and orthodoxy;
# retention of outmoded ideas and attitudes; orderly hierarchies; mercy and forgiveness. Drawer gains one point of Charisma (two points 
# if a lawful priest); priests also gain one point of Intelligence. If drawer is a priest who belongs to any organization with a hierarchical nature, reli-
# gious or secular, which does not base rank solely on levels of ability, he or she will be promoted soon, in 5-25 (1dIQ0^4 rounded up) days, after
# returning from this adventure. The Hierophant also serves as a remove curse spell for a drawer who is in need of one.
# Reversed, this card signifies overkindness, weakness; unconventionality, openness to novelty, unorthodoxy. Drawer gets a permanent -2
# on saving throws against charm, suggestion, and other mental attach forms involving force of will; he or she also receives a permanent +4 on reaction
# rolls to all persons and beings. If drawer is a member of any hierarchic body fas described above), within 5—25 (1dl00^4 rounded up) days
# of returning from the current adventure he or she will be demoted for "ineffectuality " and "lack of authority." If drawer is a chaotic priest, one point
# of Intelligence is gained.

# 06: The Lovers
# A winged supernatural being hovers over a man and a woman, behind each of whom flourishes a different tree. The man looks at the woman, but
# she, though open to him, looks up at the supernatural messenger. The Lovers are emblematic of the necessity for the conscious mind ("intelligence")
# to approach the supernatural and transcendent through the unconscious ("wisdom"), for a harmonious and loving life depends on the cooperation
# of both parts of the mind. (In older decks the Lovers are often shown as a young man standing between two women; some different divinatory
# meanings relate to this older symbolism.)
# Upright, they signify attraction, amativeness, love; difficulties overcome, tests and trials passed. The drawer's Charisma increases by one
# point for every 6 points of Wisdom or Intelligence (whichever is lower), rounding down; in addition, the drawer's reaction rolls increase l PERCENT for each
# point of Wisdom or Intelligence (whichever is lower), toward all persons (now known or encountered later) to whom she or he might be
# romantically inclined (based on race, gender, and other factors),
# Reversed, they signify tests failed; fickleness, unreliability, infidelity; a need to stabilize and harmonize the self, the possibility of a wrong
# choice. The drawer's Charisma is reduced by one point for every 6 points by which Wisdom or Intelligence (whichever is lower) falls short of 18,
# rounding losses up; reaction rolls increase as above, but based on whichever ability score is higher, and if the drawer already has a loved
# companion or spouse, the reaction roll toward her or him is reduced by half the amount that other reaction rolls are increased by (round
# reduction up).

# 07: The Chariot
# A youthful and triumphant figure (a conqueror rather than a hereditary ruler) stands in a chariot, covered over by a starry canopy and drawn by
# two steeds (horses or sphinxes) of opposing colors and pulling in somewhat opposing directions. The charioteer bears a scepter of dominion, but
# no reins; the Chariot must be controlled through the dominion of the mind. Here is represented the conqueror of the outer world, victorious yet not
# truly in control of the fullness of reality.
# Upright, the Chariot signifies triumph, success, conquest over the physical plane (including illness and one's own weaknesses) by the rational
# mind, intelligence rather than wisdom; also travel in comfort, state visits. Drawer is cured of all diseases, lycanthropy, deafness, blindness, curses,
# charms, and the like of which she or he is a victim, and will be 15% less susceptible to them from now on. Also, the drawer wilt be able to coax
# an extra 3 MV out of any vehicle, mount, or other mode of travel, as long as the drawer's mind is clear and free to concentrate.
# Reversed, it signifies decadence, ill health, restlessness, victory through foul means, disputes, failure. Drawer, over the next seven days,
# begins to manifest a severe and chronic disease, which can only be cured by a potion made from the brains of two different kinds of sphinxes. The
# disease will not prove fatal for at least 49 days.

# 08: Strength
# A calm and self-contained, yet clearly quite human woman controls the jaws of a lion with her bare hands. Strength is both hers and the lion's.
# They are not struggling, for she has already subdued the beast, and they are now in a harmony of opposites: Hers is the Strength of the mind at one with itself; his is the Strength of passion and carnal needs, which are unable to withstand a consciousness aware of its link with the infinite, and must submit to its control.
# Upright, the card signifies spiritual power overcoming material power, the fortitude of the self-aware mind; courage and magnanimity; the triumph of love over hate. The drawer gains +4 to saving throws against fear, charm, suggestion, illusion and other mental attack forms involving will force. 
# Reversed, this card signifies the dominance of the material and physical, lack of faith and moral force, failure of self-control, giving in to temptation, failure of will. Drawer suffers a -4 to saving throws against the attack forms listed above.

# 09: The Hermit
# A robed figure, the archetypal "Old Wise Man," the Hermit stands alone. He leans on a pilgrim's staff and holds up the lantern of wisdom, offering light to those who are humble enough to seek it. He illuminates the path to wisdom for those who want to emerge from darkness.
# Upright, he signifies prudent counsel, receiving wisdom or instruction from one more knowledgeable, guidance on the path to one's goal; circumspection and caution; a solitary nature. Within nine days of returning home from this adventure, drawer will meet a visiting priest of his or her own faith and of a higher level, who will offer religious instruction to the drawer, "for the improvement of the mind," with a warning that the instruction will not be quick. After one month of study (if the drawer accepts the offer; this should be a decision of the player), the drawer emerges with a 2 point increase in Wisdom, but a 1 point loss in Charisma. The priest will then give the drawer a hint to the location of a magical item, and depart for places unknown.
# Reversed, the Hermit signifies immaturity, folly, refusal to accept aging and growth. Drawer loses one third of accumulated age, gains one point of Charisma and loses two points of Wisdom. When the drawer next seeks to gain a level, the process will be three times as long and expensive as usual, because of his or her refusal to heed the instructor.

# 10: The Wheel of Fortune
# The Wheel of Fortune rotates eternally, bringing the great to naught and the humble to power, for a time. Descending (on the left) is an evil creature (often identified with Typhon or Set); ascending is a canine-headed being (often identified with Anubis, or Hermes Trismegistus); yet with another turn of the Wheel, the ascendant will descend and the descendant will ascend. Resting atop the Wheel (yet undisturbed by its rotations) is a sphinx casually holding a weapon, emblematic of the equilibrium which the enlightened mind manifests even in the midst of fortune's everchanging rounds. The sphinx, like the four winged beings of the apocalypse which occupy the corners of the field, is also a denial of the apparent randomness of the universe, and of the fatalism such false beliefs induce.
# Upright, it signifies success, fortune, felicity, an unexpected bit of luck, a change for the better. Drawer gains a permanent +2 on all saving throws; in addition, the next treasure discovered by the party will include a magical item of not less than 800 nor more than 8,000 experience points in value, on which the arms, image, and name of the drawer are ineradicably engraved or otherwise incorporated, in such a way as to mark it as predestined only for that person. If the drawer sells the item, both the card and the materials used to purchase it disintegrate, and the drawer's saving-throw bonus is negated. 
# Reversed, it signifies unexpected bad fate, ill luck, setbacks or interruptions in plans, unwanted change. Drawer suffers a -2 penalty on all saving throws; in addition, one magical item fat random) belonging to the drawer disintegrates (this does not apply if no magical items are currently owned by the character).

# 11: Justice
# Like the High Priestess and the Hierophant, Justice sits crowned and enthroned between pillars. In her right hand she bears a two-edged sword, its point toward the heavens; in her left hangs a set of balances. Firm and resolute, hers is the power of moral strength and integrity, of righteousness (good) rather than rectitude (law).
# Upright, she signifies justice, virtue, right judgments, the triumph of the good, just rewards, purity. Drawer of good alignment gains 8,000 experience points; drawer of evil alignment loses 8,000 experience points or % of all experience points, whichever is the greater; neutral drawer is unaffected. The DM may reduce these gains or losses by up to 50% if the drawer has not been entirely consistent in following his or her alignment.
# Reversed, she signifies bias, injustice, excessive severity; legal complications. Unless drawer has been acting in very strict conformance with his or her alignment (the DM should be very rigid in this evaluation), she or he is stripped of all property, effects, wealth, allegiance or loyalties of followers (those over 50% base loyalty), except for any nonmagical clothing worn; and all but '/> of his or her experience points. Drawer will also forget all spells received or memorized.

# 12: The Hanged Man
# From a gibbet or a tau-cross of living wood, a youth is suspended by one leg; his arms form a triangle behind his back, and his free leg is placed behind the bound one to form a cross (if viewed upside down, he seems to be dancing a jig). He represents Everyman, suspended by his own consent as a pause and decision point in the creation of an enlightened self. He is clearly in a contemplative state, not one of suffering, suspended between the old life and the new; he must create his new self knowingly and willingly.
# Upright, he signifies a pause, or suspension of ordinary activities; transcendence of material temptation; surrender to the purification of the self; spiritual wisdom, prophetic power; regeneration. Drawer goes into a contemplative state for 24 days, in which he or she is open-eyed, can walk (at an MVof3), drink, and eat (lightly), but will not fight or otherwise interact with the mundane world: during this period the character also regenerates as if wearing a ring of regeneration. At the end of this period, the drawer loses one point of Strength, but gains 2 points of Wisdom. For a year and a day after that, the drawer will refuse all wealth, whether earned or offered, except that necessary for his or her own modest needs and those of any henchmen.
# Reversed, The Hanged Man signifies absorption in the ego and material matters, unwillingness to sacrifice; false prophecies. Drawer goes into a trance as described above, but "snaps out of it" after ld20+5 rounds, having lost 2 points of Wisdom, but gained 1 point of Charisma. The Drawer will seem to show a new ability to prophesy the contents of rooms, intentions of strangers, etc., but after five such detailed, correct "visions," the supposed new ability will go tragically awry, and completely vanishes after being discredited.

# 13: Death
# Death, represented as a skeleton, regards a desolate plain strewn with his victims, who are of all ages and conditions, for Death has no favorites. He is sometimes shown wielding a scythe, sometimes "terrible with banners."
# Upright, he symbolizes transit to the next stage of being, transformation; abrupt and unexpected change of the old self (not usually physical death), the end of security and old situations and the beginning of a new kind of life. The drawer dies. Body and effects burst into flames (which do I Od JO points of damage if a character is foolish enough to go into them), after 1d8 rounds the flames die down and the character steps from the ashes, reborn according to the following table:
# Roll
# 01-02 Bugbear
# 03-08 Dwarf
# 09-14 Elf
# 15-16 Gnoll
# 17-22 Gnome
# 23-24 Goblin
# 25-30 Half-elf
# 31-36 Halfling
# 37-42 Half-orc
# 43-44 Hobgoblin
# 45-94 Human
# 95-96 Kobold
# 97-98 Orc
# 99-00 Ogre
# Note: A very good or very evil person will not be reborn ax a creature whose alignment is the opposite. Regardless of the form in which the character is reincarnated, allow the new form to progress as far as possible in characteristics and abilities. Someone reborn as a gnoll might eventually gain Hit Dice up to 3, 4, or even 5, plus bonus points for a high Constitution; the character would be eligible to wear armor, could use magical items available to fighters, and would have the intelligence level of its former incarnation (or racial minimum). If the new form is of a player character race, the character must be generated as a new character; the new form may be a member of any player character class for which he or she is eligible, except the old character's former class (unless that is the only possible choice), is of Ist-level, with no experience points.
#Reversed, Death signifies stagnation, mere existence, inertia or immobility, lethargy, sleep, petrification. Drawer falls under a permanent slow spell and receives no experience points for this adventure (while slowed, drawer will age at half the normal rate).

# 14: Temperance
# A solemn, angelic figure, a flower or sun emblem on its forehead, pours a fluid from one of a pair of different-colored chalices to the other; behind the figure are growing plants, and distant hills. The card represents the inner self, enabling one to balance the forces of the mind, to illuminate intelligence by wisdom and to clarify wisdom with intelligence.
# Upright, it signifies control of self, adaptation, tempering of extremes; harmonious and fruitful combinations, wise management of resources; cooperation. Drawer will gain two points of Intelligence or Wisdom (whichever of the two is presently lower) but will lose one point in whichever of the two is higher. If the two scores are equal, the drawer gains one point in whichever other characteristic is lowest, with ties settled by player preference. Also, the drawer never again injures a companion through carelessness, ill timing, bad luck, or similar circumstance.
# Reversed, this card signifies discord, hostility, failure to communicate, conflicts of interests, unfortunate combinations. Drawer gains one point in whatever characteristic is most useful for his or her class (priests and druids gain Wisdom; fighters, paladins, and rangers gain Strength; mages gain Intelligence; thieves and monks gain Dexterity; and bards gain Charisma), but loses two points from whichever of his characteristics is the lowest. If there is a tie for lowest, the loss is taken from the lowest characteristic that the DM judges to be most generally useful for the drawer's class. In addition, from now on the drawer will have a reaction roll adjustment of from —2% to —3 (50% chance for either) to all persons.

# 15: The Fiend
# Bat-winged, horned, donkey-eared, with hairy legs and eagle's feet, the Fiend stands or squats upon a blocky pedestal (which sometimes resembles an altar, sometimes an anvil). His right hand gives a cryptic salute; in his left is a weapon held in a bizarrely useless manner (a sword held by the blade, a torch which is upside down or burnt out). Connected by ropes to the altar are two figures (usually a man and a woman), mostly human but with certain animal characteristics such as horns and tails; they are much smaller than the Fiend, and appear strangely serene about their bondage.
# Upright, the card signifies the bondage of human nature to its own lowest needs and impulses, desires of greed and domination, sensation without understanding; fatality, disaster, violence; weird and destructive experiences; evil influences. Drawer is attacked by the Fiend of the Tarot (see below).
# Reversed, it signifies release from bondage to the material; conquest of pride and greed; the first steps toward spiritual enlightenment; freedom. Drawer gains one point of Wisdom and is freed of all charms, suggestions, and other spells subjecting the character to the will of another; he or she gives away ail nonessential possessions at the end of this expedition (clothing and jewelry items of less than 500 gp value may be given to player characters or NPCs; the rest going to religion and charity).

# The tarot fiend appears as shown on the deck being used except that it has the face and gender of the drawer. It has the Armor Class, Hit Points, THACO rolls, weapons and magic items, Intelligence, and size of the drawer as well. If the drawer fails to save vs. death magic, he or she is surprised by the fiend, for as many rounds as the saving throw was short. The fiend fights with a claw/claw/horn/horn routine, and if it scores two claw hits during a single round of melee it wil l also rake with its foot claws in that round for 1d4 points each. When either the drawer or the fiend is slain, the fiend disappears with all of its effects, but the drawer receives 15,000 experience points. If the drawer is killed in this combat, the experience point gain is applied to the character's total if and when the drawer is raised from the dead.

# 16: The Tower
# A tall square Tower topped with a crown is being struck by lightning, which topples the crown but leaves the tower standing. Hurtling (from its windows; it has no doors) earthward are two persons (presumably a man and a woman) in rich garments, along with showers of sparks and debris; they are stunned to see their Tower of isolation and pride broken open by a stroke of fire from the heavens.
# Upright, the Tower signifies the overthrow of existing notions, the fall of pride; sudden and unexpected change; a perceived catastrophe which may bring enlightenment in its wake; the destruction of false concepts and ideas. Drawer loses one level (from the most advanced if a multiclassed character of uneven levels, choose randomly if equal; Ist-level drawer has experience points reduced to zero), loses all magic items and wealth, but drawer gains +1 to saving throws in a column of player's choice.
# Reversed, it signifies the same to a lesser degree; but also oppression, false imprisonment or accusations; living in a rut, inability to effect worthwhile change, being stuck in an unhappy situation. Drawer loses one level (as above); aha, for a year and a day he or she is unable to gain a new level, regardless of experience points accumulated.

# 17: The Star
#A vast, flamboyant Star of eight points is surrounded by seven similar stars. In the foreground, a young woman rests one foot on land and one upon the waters, as from two identical jugs she pours the Water of Life both upon the land and into the larger body of water. Behind her is rising ground and a tree with a bird in it; in the distance are mountains.
#Upright, the Star represents inspiration freely flowing, the gifts of the spirit, the fruits of meditation, understanding, hope; good health and pleasure; granting of wishes. The next time the drawer, after having earned enough experience points to advance to the next level, spends an hour or more under a clear and starlit sky, he or she will feel inspiration pour down from the very stars, and find that the next level has been gained without formal tutoring. Drawer also gains a +2 to saving throws vs. mental illness.
# Reversed, this card signifies pessimism, doubt; chance of illness; arrogance, haughtiness, stubbornness; lack of perception. Drawer becomes so smug, arrogant, and skeptical a pupil, he or she requires twice the usual amount of tutoring before any new level can be obtained. This change is permanent.

#18: The Moon
#The crescent Moon radiates its deceptive brightness upon a dim and foreboding landscape. In the pool which fills the foreground lurks a crayfish (or other creature from the abyss); beyond this, two dogs (or a dog and a wolf) bark and howl at the Moon, which sheds a cryptic dew upon them. In the background are two towers, and a path leads from the pool to the goal beyond the towers.
#Upright, this card signifies the "dark night of the soul": trickery, deception, secret foes; unforeseen perils; bad luck for a loved one; danger, darkness, terror, occult forces; danger of falling into a trap or being misled, great danger of making an error. Drawer must make a saving throw vs. death magic or fall prey to lunacy at the next full moon. If the save is made, drawer must then save vs. polymorph or succumb to lycanthropy (as a werewolf) upon the next full moon. If both saves are made, a henchman or servitor (at random) becomes disloyal over the next,five turns (reduce loyalty and reaction rolls by ld6+4).
#Reversed, the Moon signifies peace gained at a cost; instability; lesser degrees of deception or betrayal, trifling errors. The best magic item in the possession of the drawer is permanently drained of alt magical properties; if drawer has no magic, 20% of all experience points earned on this adventure are lost.

#19: The Sun
#The Sun in its splendor shines benevolently down, either upon a pair of children playing blithely and simply together, or upon a single child riding a white horse and waving a scarlet banner. The innocent children (pair or single) are playing in front of a walled-in garden which they have left behind.
#Upright, it signifies happiness, success, contentment (particularly in marriage); achievements and studies completed, liberation to enjoy the simple pleasures; devotion, friendship. Drawer receives enough experience points to reach the next level, but not more than 19,000 in any case. Also, drawer has a +1 reaction roll to all persons met later or known presently, and they have a +1 reaction to the drawer.
#Reversed, this card signifies unhappiness, loneliness; plans and triumphs delayed; broken friendships or engagements; possible loss of a job or home. Drawer loses all henchmen and servitors after returning from this expedition (they leave town, take another leader, or otherwise leave for "personal reasons " but do not become hostile). If drawer is a henchman or vassal of another, he or she is dismissed, or stripped of offices, unless a saving throw vs. death magic is successful. Also, the drawer is stripped of enough experience points to he reduced to the bottom of his or her present level, but not more than 9,500 in any case.

# 20: Judgment
#An angel sounds forth the call to Judgment from a trumpet to which is attached a banner bearing a cross; the clouds from which it emerges radiate power. Below, a figure rises from a tomb while on each side a man and woman also rise; all these figures are as one in the wonder, adoration, and ecstatic awe which their whole bodies express as they answer the summons.
#Upright, this card signifies rebirth, renewal, awakening; rejuvenation, change of personal consciousness; a life well lived and a work well done; atonement, judgment, the need to forgive and to seek forgiveness, sincere self-appraisal. Drawer becomes a young adult over the course of the next hour (if not one already) but without any changes in characteristics. To determine exact age, select a young-adult age randomly, then add half the difference between that age and maximum youngadult age, rounding down. If drawer is already a young adult, he or she will become 90% of the minimum young-adult age. If the drawer's behavior is judged by the DM to have been strictly consistent -with the character's alignment and religion (observance of taboos, donations, etc.), 2d6 hit points, determined randomly, are also gained. The gain can only be up to the maximum possible number of hit points for that character.
#Reversed, it signifies weakness; stupidity; a sentencing; disillusionment, disappointment; indecision leading to procrastination and delay. Drawer is affected as if struck by a ray of enfeeblement/rom a mage 3rd-level or of the same level as the drawer (whichever is higher); the drawer is also henceforth subject to a penalty of 1 on initiative rolls, due to her or his inability to choose between alternatives.

# 21: The World
#Surrounding by an elliptical wreath of living foliage is a female figure dancing joyously, a short wand in each hand. In the four corners of the card are the heads of the four beings of the apocalypse, hovering protectively outside the wreath. Her legs form a cross, as do those of the Hanged Man, but she stands upright, supported by the ether, the very fabric of the World; her dance is of the sensitive life, of joy attained in the body, of the soul's intoxication in a World-turned-paradise.
#Upright, the World signifies completion, success, triumph in all things, perfection, fulfillment; the path of liberation and enlightenment; the admiration of others. Drawer gains one point to each ability score that is two or more below racial maximum.
#Reversed, this card signifies imperfection, failure, lack of vision, failure to complete task; fear of change or travel, fixity, permanence, stagnation. After 1d4 days, drawer begins to develop an increasing distrust of strange places: other cities or countries, dungeons, wildernesses, new taverns, all places. Within an additional 2d4 days this becomes full-blown paranoia, with drawer believing that everyone and everything outside his or her home (eventually, there too) is out to get him or her, and that any so-called "friend" or "loved one " who tries to get the drawer to come out into the world is clearly part of the conspiracy.

#THE MINOR ARCANA

Fulfillment of the task gains each participant an additional 1,000 XP, in addition to the XP reward for the monster,
#Reversed, the Ace of Wands signifies false starts, clouded joy, ruin, decadence, cancellation of projects, failure, and retreat. Effects as above, but the compulsion is to cancel the expedition and return to base as quickly as practical.

#Reversed, the Two of Wands signifies trouble, fear, sadness, surprise. Drawer's saving throws against fear and hopelessness are reduced by 1.

#A calm personage, back turned, leans lightly upon one of three wands planted in the ground, and looks out across a sea, beyond which are mountains.

(This should be an established NPC already friendly to the drawer.)
#Reversed, the Three of Wands signifies cessation of adversity, an end to or suspension of difficulties; assistance with an ulterior motive. Effects as above, but the NPC will be planning to trick or betray the drawer. This could be by stealing a magic item from the drawer, robbing and stranding the character on an island, or other misadventure; generally (80%), the betrayal is not meant to be fatal.

#25: Four of Wands
#Four great wands are garlanded with chains of flowers, two women bear flowers, and behind them is a bridge over a moat, leading to a castle or manor.
#Upright, the Four of Wands signifies repose, peace, rural refuge, country domesticity and felicity. When drawer returns from this expedition to home or headquarters, after healing is finished, the character feels a strong desire to rest a while at home; for every month of rest thereafter up to four months, the drawer (unknowingly) receives 1,000 XP. The desire may be resisted (roll for saving throw vs. spell, at -2, not more than once a week), but can continue beyond the four-month period.
#Reversed, the meaning is the same but less intense. Effects as above, but only 500 XP are given per month, and saving throws to resist the desire are at—I.

#26: Five of Wands
# Five youths are apparently battling with huge wands, yet there is no sign of actual bodily injury.
#Upright, it signifies competition, strife, differences of opinion, nonfatal struggle. The effects of discord (as per the symbol) will befall the drawer's party after ld4+3 turns; grappling and other nonlethal combat techniques will he used, but serious injuries are nonetheless possible.
#Reversed, the Five of Wands signifies victory after surmounting obstacles, contradictions, or trickery. All characters involved in the party's next victorious combat receive double experience points for the action; thieves in the party have a 10% better success rate in thefts attempted upon their own companions until the end of this adventure.

#27: Six of Wands
#A rider crowned with a laurel wreath bears a wand adorned with a laurel wreath, and is accompanied by five staff-bearing figures on foot. 
#Upright, it signifies victory, triumph, good tidings, the successful completion of a struggle. Drawer is doubly effective (double damage for weapon-wielders) in attacks against the next foe; mages 'spells are of three times' normal duration, and saving throws against such spells is now at —3.
#Reversed, it signifies indefinite delay, disloyalty, the success of an enemy, fear. Drawers learn upon returning from this adventure that his or her most hated and feared opponent has had a great success and is said to be intent upon attacking the drawer soon.

Even a Ist-level character will have had a rival fellow apprentice, a traditional family or clan enemy, or something of the sort.

#Reversed, the Eight of Wands signifies delay, stagnation; quarrels and disputes. When next attached, the entire party is slowed^cr ld8+8 rounds; afterward, those who do not save vs. spell suffer discord (as with the symbol), but they will not attack with lethal weapons.

One time before the end of this adventure, drawer and party will be able to return to a designated sanctuary (as the priest spell word of recall) for 9—12 turns. They may bind their wounds, refresh themselves, and the like, but may not pick up or drop anything, nor communicate with anyone. At the end of the duration, they will reappear at the time and place they left from, in the same positions and carrying the same equipment.

#Reversed, it signifies loss, separation, immigration; intrigue. Drawer is teleported a distance of 1d4 levels in a dungeon setting, or 2d10 miles in a city or wilderness setting, to a place he or she is not familiar with at all.

# The Court Cards
# The Court Cards of each suit (King, Queen, Knight, and Page) signify a being who will aid or attack the drawer, depending on whether the card
# is drawn upright or reversed. Each of these beings is a material form of that which is symbolized by the card (their appearance will be exactly that of
# the person depicted on the card) rather than a natural being (human or otherwise); thus, they may possess combinations of classes or other attributes
# which might be forbidden to player characters or NPCs, They will materialize the next time the drawer is attacked by another creature or
# character, and then engage in combat until the combat is resolved by the defeat of one side or the other, or by the successful evasion of one

If the drawer is a priest, each cup will work 21 times.

# Upright, it signifies remembrance of things past, the joys and happiness of days gone by. Drawer sees a clear vision of a beloved friend and companion of days gone by (one who is still alive). Within 1d8 days of the drawer's return from this adventure, a parcel arrives from the old friend, passed on by an obliging merchant or other appropriate courier. In addition to a  letter of reminiscences, the parcel will include either a gem of 4,000 gp value or less (49%), an item of jewelry of 4,000 gp value or less (40%), or a minor (gp and XP values of 4,000 or less) miscellaneous magical item usable by the drawer (11%).
# Reversed, it signifies renewal, thoughts of the future, that which is to come. Drawer has a clear vision of the next being or group of beings the party is to encounter after they have finished with the Tarot (although not the meaning of the vision, of course).

#42. Seven of Cups
# A startled figure is confronted by seven cups overflowing with fantastic visions: castles, dragons, jewels, and other sights more bizarre. 
# Upright, it signifies daydreaming, dissipation, wishful thinking, ephemeral or illusory success. Drawer has a -2 penalty on saving throws vs. illusions from now on.
# Reversed, it signifies resolution, determination, strength of will, intelligent choice. Drawer will save at +2 vs. illusions from now on; illusion specialists will gain one level instead.

# 43: Eight of Cups
# A dejected figure with a pilgrim's staff leaves eight neatly stacked cups behind and trudges up a barren moonlit mountain into the distance.
# Upright, the Eight of Cups signifies abandonment of success, disappointment in material gains, the discarding of what has been achieved for a higher goal; journeying from place to place. Over the remainder of this expedition drawer will feel an increasing discontent and an increase in religious interests. Within eight days of returning home from this adventure, the character will sell all nonportable properties, abdicate (or at least take leave from) all official positions, and enter a religious retreat for 4d8 weeks (after donating half of all worldly goods to the faith). If drawer is eligible, he or she becomes a priest, druid, or paladin of his or her deity (allowing for alignment, gender, and racial requirements, and the restrictions listed in the PHB). Priests, druids, and paladins will stay in religious retreat for a year and a day, emerging with 4,000 additional experience points. Those who fall into neither of these classifications emerge from retreat with renewed spirituality and 1,000 extra experience points.
# Reversed, this card signifies feasting, joy, striving for material success, gaiety, a less spiritual outlook. While healing and resting after the end of this expedition, drawer will become increasingly restive and frivolous. As soon as it is safe to do so, he or she will spend at least 8% of total wealth on a feast or series of feasts and carousals, stopping onty after money starts running low or a daily saving throw vs. death magic (at —2) is successful, Depending on alignment, deity, and profession, this debauchery may require atonement by the drawer.

#44: Nine of Cups
# A prosperous figure, having feasted happily, rests before a counter on which nine cups, generously filled, have been neatly arranged.
# Upright, the Nine of Cups signifies success, satisfaction, all the good things of life, well being, the granting of wishes. Drawer gains one immediate wish, which can only be used for physical or material matters (thus, it could be used to restore hit points, but not to raise an Intelligence score).
# Reversed, it signifies misplaced confidence, false assurance, material loss, imperfections, mistakes, disputes, failure to fulfill a wish. Effects as above, but the wish will go wrong in one of various ways; thus, a wish to bring a character back to life might result in the deceased becoming a zombie (as the spell animate dead,), or a wish to transport the party into the fortress of an enemy might transport them into the cells of the dungeon, without keys. The mistake or flaw may be disastrous, but should not be fatal in and of itself.

# 45: Ten of Cups
# Ten cups in a rainbow appear as in a vision; beneath it a couple raises their arms in joy and ecstasy and two children dance together blithely; a home stands in the background.
# Upright, it signifies contentment, repose of the heart, perfection of love and friendship, peace. Reaction and loyalty scores of the drawer's friends and associates increase by +4.
# Reversed, it signifies betrayal, loss of friendship, waste, criminal behavior strife, hatred, resentment. Reaction and loyalty scores of the drawer s friends and associates decrease by 'A of their present amount (round losses up), but at least -2 in any case.

65,<i>Two of Pentacles</i> A youth in frivolous costume dances and juggles two pentacles; in the background ships are tossed on the high sea. This card signifies gaiety, lightheartedness, grace under pressure, but also difficulty in launching new ventures or adapting to additional burdens; variability of moods. Drawer gains one point of Dexterity, but receives only half the experience points actually earned until he or she has enough experience points for the next level. At this point, drawer will take twice the usual time for training and study, in order to gain the new level.
66,<i>Three of Pentacles</i> A master artist or mason carving pentacles in stonework is regarded approvingly by two robed figures (probably priests), one of whom holds a set of plans from which the crafter has been working.

67,<i>Four of Pentacles</i> A hunched-over figure, crowned with one pentacle, grasps another fervently with hands and arms, and stands firmly upon two more; he clings avidly to what is already held. This card signifies making sure of material gains; worldly gain leading to nothing beyond it; sometimes (not always) miserliness and a lack of generosity, but always a monetary, mercenary concern and point of view. Drawer receives no experience points for any material gains made during this expedition, except thieves, who suffer only a 10 <b>percent</b> penalty.
68,<i>Five of Pentacles</i> Two ragged figures (one on crutches), a man and a woman, pass beneath a lighted window in a snowstorm. They are clearly in distress. It signifies loss of home, destitution, joblessness; affinities discovered through mutual suffering; generally, troubles in the material-financial realm. Within 5 weeks of returning from this adventure, the drawer will lose all homes, savings, jewelry, magic items and other valuables, and job(including henchman status), if any; for 5d10 ({Dice~5d10}) weeks after drawing this card, drawer will be doubly susceptible to illness, and to parasitic infestations. If drawer has a lover or spouse, they will each increase in loyalty toward each other by 5 <b>percent</b>.
69,<i>Six of Pentacles</i> An opulently dressed figure, probably a merchant, gives money to the distressed from a balance or scales, giving out of goodness of heart from present wealth and plenty. The Six of Pentacles signifies just and righteous charity, gifts and inheritance, wealth received for good reason, just desserts. When the proceeds of this expedition are divided up, drawer's share is 6d6 ({Dice~6d6}) <b>percent</b> larger than it normally would be; drawer will give at least half of this bonus to a good religious body, or to a charity(these monies are not to be given to a player character, NPC, or ruler, regardless of alignments). The effects of this good act, if done by an evil or neutral character, must be adjudicated by the DM.
70,<i>Seven of Pentacles</i> An intense young man leaning upon his staff hovers protectively near seven pentacles attached to the greenery of the garden-like space he is tending. It signifies speculative pauses, fretting, anxiety, success not yet attained, disappointment. During the next project the drawer is engaged in which a long period of time passes(training for a new level, enchanting an item, anything requiring 10 days or more for completion), he or she must make a DC 16 Will save once each week. Failure to make a successful saving throw means that the drawer has ruined the process through over anxiousness, and must begin anew or pay whatever penalty is imposed for such interruption.

71,<i>Eight of Pentacles</i> An artist sits happily carving out a pentacle; other completed examples are racked neatly nearby. Upright, this card signifies work, craftsmanship, skills (perhaps still at an apprentice level); job or commission to come.

72,<i>Nine of Pentacles</i> A stately woman stands in a flourishing vineyard, presumably part of her manorial domain. On her wrist is a tame hawk; she is otherwise alone, and seems serene in her isolation. The Nine of Pentacles signifies security, prudence, wealth, self-sufficiency, love of gardens and home, comfort in material matters. For the rest of this expedition or adventure, any pickpocketing attempts upon the drawer fail(although the thief will not be caught); and until the drawer returns, his or her home is safe from robbery, burglary, and banditry. Drawer also gains +2 ranks in Craft(gardening). If a mage with no familiar, the next time the drawer is in an outdoor setting a hawk will come, tamely, to serve as a familiar; it will be fully trained for hunting too.
73,<i>Ten of Pentacles</i> A man and a woman stand in the entry way of a house; a child and an elderly man each pet a dog contentedly. The card denotes gain, security, riches, family, home, stability.

74,<i>Page of Pentacles</i> A Pentacle rests lightly in, or hovers over, the hands of the Page, a very dark youth who moves slowly through a flourishing field, his gaze seemingly fixed upon the lone symbol in studious reverie.

76,<i>Queen of Pentacles</i> Very dark of coloring and meditative of expression, the Queen contemplates her Pentacle on a throne in a fertile bower; her serious, even melancholy mien suggests that she sees curious things indeed within that symbol.

50,<i>Ace of Swords</i> Issuing from a cloud, a hand grasps an upright sword, topped by a crown from which hang branches of olive and laurel. It signifies debacle, disaster, lack of productivity, Pyrrhic victory. The next time drawer hits an opponent in physical combat, his or her weapon will do 2d4 plus the normal points of damage but then shatters irreparably. If the blow is with a body part, said part will suffer a severe break, requiring a <i>heal</i> spell and four weeks of immobility to become useful again. This applies even if the drawer was attempting to strike to subdue.
51,<i>Two of Swords</i> A blindfolded female figure balances two swords upon her shoulders beneath a new moon; behind her is a turbulent or rocky sea.  It signifies treachery, disloyalty, duplicity, release, movement of affairs in the wrong direction.

52,<i>Three of Swords</i> Against a turbulent background, a heart is pierced by three swords. This card signifies division, quarreling, separation, upheaval, civil war or political struggle, arguments. Those members of the party who do not make successful DC 19 Will saves start a violent fight within the party in the next 10-40 ({Dice~10d4}) minutes; the drawer does not get a saving throw. The basis of the fight may be philosophical, racial, political, or religious. Those quarreling cannot be stopped (except forcefully, by those who made the saving throw) until at least one party member is unconscious or dead. Those party members with a Wisdom of more than seven may use nonlethal combat methods. The effects of the card wear off in 1d4+3 ({Dice~1d4+3}) hours, but the animosities created or revealed may linger.
53,<i>Four of Swords</i> The image of a warrior lies upon a tomb or altar; alongside it is one sword, and three more hang in the background. This card signifies circumspection, precautions, a need for careful administration, economy, prudent action. Drawer gains a permanent 10/% increase in the chance of success of precautionary measures (listening at doors, attempting to detect evil/good, casting <i>augury</i>, and the like); but if the drawer is careless, the chance for him or her to be surprised is 35/%(-7 on Perception checks) greater.
54,<i>Five of Swords</i> A scornful youth watches as two dejected figures slouch away; two swords lie on the ground, two more are slung over the youth's shoulder, and he holds the fifth pointed toward the ground. The sky is clouded and stormy. This card signifies defeat, dishonor, loss, degradation, infamy, destruction, conquest, cruelty, failure, sorrow, weakness, funerals, loss of a friend.

55,<i>Six of Swords</i> A ferry keeper conveys solemn passengers to a further shore across calm waters. Six swords stand hilt-up along the edge of the boat. It signifies outcry, lack of immediate solution, staying in place.

Drawer also becomes permanently sensitive (-1 on saving throw) to attack forms based on loud sounds or outcries.
56,<i>Seven of Swords</i> A scurrying figure rushes away with five swords, while two other swords are left behind. This card signifies wishes soon to be fulfilled, chance of unexpected success; sound counsel, instruction. The next plan devised in part or whole by the drawer that involves at least 7/% but no more than 49/% chance of failure, will be a success, if the scheme is based on stealth, cunning, or deception (rather than a "smash and grab" operation).
57,<i>Eight of Swords</i> A female figure, her eyes covered, stands alone, surrounded by the swords of the card. It signifies prior treachery, disquiet, unforeseen mishap, fatality. Drawer encounters wandering monsters at twice the normal chance until the end of this adventure.
58,<i>Nine of Swords</i> A woman, racked with despair, is surrounded by the swords of the card; she is blanketed with roses, but feels only their thorns. It signifies doubt, suspicion, shame, patient suffering, "time heals all wounds," timidity, reasonable fear.
