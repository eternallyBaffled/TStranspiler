# Magical-item misfirings in the AD&D(R) game
#
# by Rich Stump, modified for GM's Notebook by JB Willers
#
# The AD&D(R) game has one of the largest compilations of magical items
# in the fantasy gaming industry.  Unfortunately, this does not prevent
# many of the players from buying, borrowing, or stealing copies of the
# Dungeon Master's Guide for the sole purpose of memorizing the magical
# item treasure tables.  Once one of these people has implanted the
# entire collection of magical devices into his brain, it becomes very
# hard for the DM to keep that player on his toes.
#
# Modified by Valminder April 2002
#    I changed the "START" line to generate quirks for all kinds of
#    magical items with only one "click" of a button.
#    I also modified the quirks for 3e D&D.
#
#    Creatures.Type
#    Miscellaneous.Color
#
# Modified by Valminder August 2005
#    Added Blood quirks (Dward, Elf, Orc, Gnome, Halfling, Human)
#    Added negative level if not of appropriate alignment
#       (Chaos, Good, Law, Evil, Neutral)
#    Added Self-Identifying items (Magic of Faerun). It should be a 40%
#       chance of being self-identifying, but the table is set at 20%.
#    Altered the table slightly.
#    Modified -Creatures.tab
#    Added links to
#       -Religion.tab
# Modified by Valminder August 2007
#    Added some quirks.
#
# Modified by Valminder July 2010
#    Modified some errors, tweaked the table a little bit.
#    Added armor, shields, rings, rods common quirks (like light, special material).
#    Added armor/weapons size.
#
# Modified by Valminder March 2015
#    Added an 'Alternate' table to link with "Treasure generator MC"

5,Imbiber gets extremely hungry immediately after the potion is consumed (as per a <i>chime of hunger</i>).
5,Drinker's senses sharpen while the potion is in effect, or for a maximum of 10 minutes (whichever is longer).  He gains a +2 bonus for Spot and Listen checks.

5,Alternate Form: Potion is found in powdered form; water has to be added to the powder for the potion to be effective.
1,Alternate Form: Magic Fruit: Apples and pomegranates with magical properties are commonplace in mythology. A potion-fruit might consist of a slice or section of a fruit steeped in a magical libation that produces its effect when consumed.
1,Alternate Form: Magic Tiles: A small ceramic tile inscribed with a magic rune could hold a potion-type effect. When it is snapped or broken in one's hand, the effect is released.
1,Alternate Form: Skull Talismans: The skull of a small animal (a bird, mouse, or rat, for example) is enchanted with a single spell. When crushed in one's hand or underfoot, the skull talisman releases its stored effect.
1,Alternate Form: Spell Wafers: A thin wafer of specially prepared bread or dough, stamped with a holy or arcane symbol, can hold a spell as well as a potion bottle can. When the wafer is consumed, the stored magic takes effect.

1,Scroll glows as a torch (20' rad, 40' shadowy illumination) a random color ([~Miscellaneous.Color]) when used, opened, or read.
5,Scroll is old and brittle; any mishandling causes it to disintegrate. A scroll of this type has no saving throw against any type of energy.
5, Scroll is written in scrawled script and is barely legible; a 5 <b>percent</b> chance exists of blowing the spell in addition to any other such chance.
5,Scroll is waterproof and can be read underwater.
5,Scroll is exceedingly long and takes 1 full round to unroll and prepare for spell-casting. Then you can use it normally.
5,Scroll is specially treated and has [~Energy] Resistance 10.

5,Scroll can only be torn by someone making a Strength check DC<b>{Dice~1d10+10}</b> and it has hardness 10 and 10 hp.
5,Scroll is written in magical hieroglyphics; <b>{Dice~1d5+5}</b> days must be spent translating the characters before the scroll is usable, or a <i>comprehend languages</i> must be cast upon it.
5, Scroll is more powerful than normal; any saving throws against a spell from the scroll are at DC +2, and the duration of any spell is 125 <b>percent</b> normal.
1,Scroll is very powerful; all spells have a save DC +4, and the duration of a spell on this scroll is 150 <b>percent</b> normal.
5,Scroll is substandard in power; all saving throws against spells from the scroll are at DC -2, and the duration of any spell is 75 <b>percent</b> of normal.
5,Scroll's print disorients reader for <b>{Dice~1d4}</b> rounds after a spell from it is cast. During this time, the reader is shaken.<br>
_<u>Shaken Condition</u>: -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
5, Scroll is written improperly; any spell on it will fail 50 <b>percent</b> of the time (but the spell is not erased from the scroll until a second reading).
1,Scroll is specially magicked; the spells on it can be used twice each before they vanish.
5,Scroll is permanently stuck in a magically strong rolled-up form; in order to cast a spell from it, the reader must make a Strength check DC<b>{Dice~1d10+10}</b>. If the check fails, he is unable to keep the scroll held open for that round. Another try may be made the next round. The scroll cannot be ripped or torn.
5,Scroll is written on a sheet of thin metal instead of on paper. It has a hardness of 8.
5,Scroll's writing is hidden by an <i>illusory script</i> spell.
5,Scroll's writing is hidden by a <i>secret page</i> spell.
5,Scroll is protected by a spell, such as <i>sepia snake sigil</i> or <i>magic mouth</i>. The protective spell is activated any time the scroll is opened, unless a special bypass word is spoken.

_<u>Dazed Condition</u>: The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.
5,Scroll's spells are written in complicated terms; the casting times of all spells upon the scrolls are doubled.
5,Scroll is slow to take effect; all spells take effect the round after the casting is finished.  Once the casting time is complete, hitting the reader will not disrupt the spell.
1,Alternate Form: Gemstone: A complex series of gestures and sounds is completed with a specially prepared gemstone in hand, and the spell stored within it is released when the final words are spoken. Like the parchment on which a scroll is scribed, a gemstone is emptied by casting but can be reused again.<br>
_When a scroll is found in the course of a campaign, deciphering its magical text is usually the first step to using it, but since variant scroll forms that don't have spells stored in written form can't be deciphered with <i>read magic</i>, they must be identified with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).
1,Alternate Form: Incendiary: A spell is stored in a special mix of powders and glyph-covered paper. To use an incendiary, a spellcaster speaks the last words of the spell while simultaneously igniting the prepared device (usually by means of a minor magical property of the incendiary form that requires no additional action to activate). The incendiary is consumed in a brilliant colored flash or haze of strangely coiling smoke, completing the spell.
_When a scroll is found in the course of a campaign, deciphering its magical text is usually the first step to using it, but since variant scroll forms that don't have spells stored in written form can't be deciphered with <i>read magic</i>, they must be identified with a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).
1,Alternate Form: Macrame: A spell is held in a small, complex weave of precisely tied knots. The user pulls apart the knotted square by choosing the right strands while speaking the spell's activation words.<br>

5,Ring cannot use its offensive power against any creature of 1 HD or less.

5,Ring magically grafts itself to the wearer's finger and cannot be removed by any means other than employing a <i>wish</i> or physically removing the finger from the wearer's body.
5,Wearer of the ring is colorblind and can see only in black and white for as long as the ring is worn. If the wearer is naturally colorblind, he can see normal colors in the visible spectrum for as long as the ring is worn. If the ring is taken off, sight returns to its natural state.

5,Ring is specially enchanted and has [~Energy] Resistance 10.

_<u>Exhausted Condition</u>: Half speed, -6 Strength and Dexterity.
5,Ring emits a hum audible to those within a 10' radius whenever its powers are used.
5,Wearer's metabolism is slowed by wearing the ring; consequently, only half the daily amount of food and water needs to be eaten.

1,Ring is inhabited by a vain minor spirit who wills its wearer to polish the ring daily. If this is not done, the spirit withholds the ring's powers for one day for each time it is not polished.
1,The item is intelligent; roll on the sword intelligence table and disregard any result of no intelligence. The item also has an ego. Though it will tell its owner of the powers it offers, it will never disclose the number of charges it possesses. Note that an intelligent item will never willingly use its last few charges! It has no power nor skill points, other than being intelligent.
5,[NegativeLevel]
5,[Blooded]

5,The item is inefficient; double the number of charges expended for each use.
5,The item has an extra command word that allows it to shrink to half its normal size or return to its normal size.

5,The item's wielder must concentrate for one round when speaking the command word in order to activate the item's powers.

5,The item is hard to snap or break. A Strength check DC<b>{Dice~1d10+15}</b> is required to break it.
5,The item will not work if the wielder is wearing metal armor of any kind (including elven chain mail).
5,The item has a tendency to overload. It can be used up to 3 times in a 24-hour period. Any uses beyond that limit cause the item to short itself out for 24 hours, and the charges activated are lost.
5,The item is extremely powerful; any saves against its effects are at DC +2.
5,The item is unable to function in environments colder than freezing.
5,The item is unable to function in environments warmer than normal human body temperature.
5,The item will not function underwater.
5,The item will activate whenever the command word is spoken by anyone within 30', whether it is being held or not.
5,The item can be used as a weapon (if it is not already one). It is considered as a magic weapon to counter damage reduction, but has no actual bonus to hit or on damage. A wand does 1d4 points of damage; a rod and a staff do 1d6 damage (as a club and staff respectively).
1,If all of the item's charges are used, it explodes in a fiery blast.  The blast has a radius of 15' and does <b>{Dice~5d4}</b> hp damage to anyone therein.  The one holding the item receives no saving throw; others may make a Reflex save DC<b>{Dice~1d10+10}</b> for half damage.
5,The item is capable of being placed on automatic mode; every round, it will perform one function as designated by the wielder, using the normal amount of charges, until it is taken off automatic mode. During this time, the wielder is able make other actions. It takes a move action to aim the item. If no action is taken, the item uses the same target as before. If the target cannot be seen, it aims at the feet of the caster.
1,(ROD ONLY) The item is intelligent; roll on the sword intelligence table and disregard any result of no intelligence. The item also has an ego. Though it will tell its owner of the powers it offers, it will never disclose the number of charges it possesses. Note that an intelligent item will never willingly use its last few charges! It has no power nor skill points, other than being intelligent.
5,[NegativeLevel]
5,[Blooded]
5,The item radiates a [~Alignment] alignment when detected. No other effect.
5,The item is mentally tiring; each use requires a Will save (DC 12) or the user takes 1 point of temporary lntelligence damage.
5,[Cursed]
1,[Given]
1,Using the most powerful power of this item permanently drains 1 hp from the wielder.

;!Item
10,The item glows as a candle (5' radius shadowy illumination) a random color ([~Miscellaneous.Color]) when its powers manifest.
1,The item glows as a torch (20' rad, 40' shadowy illumination) a random color ([~Miscellaneous.Color]) when its powers manifest.
5,Item has a habit of burying itself in any sack, backpack, or container in which it is carried. If other items are in the container, 1 Full-Round is necessary for someone to find and retrieve the item.
5,Item works normally, but it appears dirty and ready to fall apart. For example, a <i>cloak of protection +1</i> might be moth-eaten and stained, but still functional.
5,Item attunes itself to one owner at a time; if it is removed from its owner, or if another person tries to use the device, it goes dormant for <b>{Dice~1d4}</b> days as it grows accustomed to its new owner. It takes this same number of days for the powers to manifest.
5,Item has the annoying habit of buzzing when it is used. The buzzing is audible to anyone within 60', and it is impossible to surprise anyone while the device is buzzing.
5,Item is durable and makes any necessary saving throws at +2 to the die roll.
5,Item will not function if user wears any kind of head adornment (including a hood).
5,Item will not function underwater.
5,Item will not function underground.
5,Item will not function at night. Also, it is good aligned and radiates this alignment.
5,Item will not function during the day. Also, it is evilly aligned and radiates this alignment.
5,Item is unaffected by blows of any kind.
5,Item has a finite number of uses; it will be found with <b>{Dice~2d20}</b> charges remaining.
5,Item works erratically; roll 1d100.<br>
_.....01-70 Items functions normally.<br>
_.....71-90 Items fails to function.<br>
_.....91-00 Item acts as a <i>rod of wonder</i>, roll on the appropriate table.
5,Item is magically buoyant and tends to levitate upward at the rate of 5' per minute unless held or tied down.
5,Item is immune to [~Energy] damage, magical or not.
5,Item can only be used twice per day; if used more often, it will short itself out and be unusable for 24 hours.
1,Item causes its owner to become extremely possessive of it. If the item is kept for more than 14 days, a mild form of paranoia sets in. The owner will assume that anyone mentioning the item wants it. The owner will never relinquish the item to anyone as a result. A <i>remove curse</i>, or getting rid of the item before 14 days pass, are the only ways to negate the paranoia effect.
5,Item is powerful; it works 125 <b>percent</b> more effectively than a standard item of the same type, and any saving throw against its effects is at DC +1.
5,Item is substandard and only works half as well as a standard item of the same type.
5,Item has a curse upon it. All saving throws attempted by its owner are made at DC -2 until the owner frees itself from the item (<i>remove curse</i>).
1,Item belongs to an extraplanar creature or other powerful being (this is shown on the item by the creature's personal sign).  After <b>{Dice~1d4}</b> weeks, the item will be located by the being, and it will show up to claim "its" property.
5,Item must rest for 1 hour minimum between uses.
5,Item cannot be destroyed by any means short of an incredible excess of force (such as a deity), by dropping it into a lava pit, or the like.
1,The item is intelligent; roll on the sword intelligence table and disregard any result of no intelligence. The item also has an ego. Though it will tell its owner of the powers it offers, it will never disclose the number of charges it possesses. Note that an intelligent item will never willingly use its last few charges! It has no power nor skill points, other than being intelligent.

5, Armor is heavy; add 25 <b>percent</b> to its total weight and encumbrance, and a -1 armor penalty.

5,Armor is an exquisite piece of workmanship and commands a price of 150 <b>percent</b> of its normal value due to its quality.

The chance of a possession attempt occurring is 5 <b>percent</b> per week, cumulative.
1,The item is intelligent; roll on the sword intelligence table and disregard any result of no intelligence. The item also has an ego. Though it will tell its owner of the powers it offers, it will never disclose the number of charges it possesses. Note that an intelligent item will never willingly use its last few charges!

5,Weapon is lighter than normal. The wielder has a +1 bonus on initiative when the weapon is used.
5,Weapon is unable to harm one type of creatures ([~Creatures.Type]).
5,Weapon must be used two-handed in order to gain its magical bonus. If the weapon is very short (e.g., a dagger or knife), is already a two-handed weapon, or this result does not otherwise apply, disregard this result and roll again on this table (see below).<br>OR<br>[Weapon]
5,Weapon's finish cannot be marred, stained, or scratched in any way.
5,Weapon hums whenever it is held (and the sound negates any chance of surprise).
5,Weapon must be baptized in flame after combat, or it loses its magical bonus until it is placed within a fire for at least one hour (weapon is immune to the effects of normal fire).
5,Weapon must be cleaned and sharpened after every combat or its damage dice will go down by one category (cumulative).
5,Weapon is twice as heavy as normal. The wielder suffers a -1 penalty to all initiative rolls when using this weapon.

5,Weapon exhibits no magical properties until a certain condition is met (i.e., a <i>bless</i> spell is cast upon it, a certain type of creature is killed with it, etc.).
5,Weapon is unaffected by [~Energy] damage.

1,Weapon is silent; it makes no noise when dropped or struck against armor or another weapon.
1,Weapon's magic makes it dangerous to wield in combat. If the wielder misses an attack against his intended opponent, he must make a Dexterity check DC<b>{Dice~1d10+10}</b> or the weapon slips. An attack roll must be made against any ally in a 5' radius (or against the wielder, if no allies are near). A successful hit on oneself or a friend does half damage.
1,Weapon cannot be broken by any means short of divine power or an irresistible force (such as having 10 tons of rock dropped on it).
5,Weapon is resistant: +2 hardness, +10 hit points.
5,Weapon is immune to the effects of rust (including the attack of a rust monster).
