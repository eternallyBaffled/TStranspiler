#
# by Larry Cormier Adapted for TableSmith from a booklet called:
# Combat Swipes by Johnn Four; rpt-combat-swipes.pdf

# Thanks Johnn, I took your advice, and have created this TableSmith table
# based on the wonderful suggestions in your article; i.e.,

# recommend that anyone else who uses this table do the same!

1,[~MeleeAttackSuccess]

:MeleeAttackSuccess
1,Your weapon whistles past with almost no resistance, but torn clothes and a shallow cut on the [~BodyPartAll] skin beneath confirm the hit.
2,Torchlight glints off the cruel blade of your weapon as it arcs through the air, biting into your foe’s [~BodyPartAll] with a satisfying Tchunk! Your forearm is numb from the impact, and your face is soaked warm with crimson in the resulting arterial spray.
3,(Result: First attack near miss, second attack critical hit)  With a single step and a nimble swing, your sword arcs toward the nape of your opponent’s neck. He barely shifts his weapon in time to prevent the blow from connecting, but pushes too far. You deftly draw your stroke in just a few inches, barely making contact with his blade, before thrusting it straight through his [~BodyPartAll]. His body locks up, twitching, your blade nearly pulled from your hand as you try to withdraw it. He falls, still writhing, but not for long....
4,Dropping low under his attack, you stomp on his [~BodyPartAll] with a satisfying crunch. While he reels with pain, you drive forward and sink your blade into his [~BodyPartAll]. His dying breath, sour and rotten, fills your nose before you kick him off your sword and move on.
5,The blade bites deep, leaving a gushing wound on his [~BodyPartAll].
6,Your weapon slices across your foe’s [~BodyPartAll]. He screams in rage, clutching his wound as blood pours down.
7,Seeing the opening, you quickly wheel, driving your weapon into the side of your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll]. He falls as his support is knocked out from under him.
8,You deflect his attack with your sword and chop his [~BodyPartAll] with your free hand.
9,As you strike, your opponent raises [~AorAnBodyPartAll], absorbing the hit that would have otherwise have landed squarely on his [~BodyPartHigh]. However, you can feel your blade scrape bone, and as he retracts his blocking arm you clearly see a trail of blood streaming from his wound.
10,Even with your clumsy hands, you manage to jab your weapon into your foe's [~BodyPartAll], who roars in pain.
11,You grasp your sword by the blade and swing, causing the pommel to dent your enemy’s pauldron. His [~BodyPartAll] cracks, and you feel the satisfying reverberations quiver up your sword.
12,You leap into the air, viciously driving your weapon behind your opponent’s [~BodyPartHigh] as you narrowly miss his skull.
13,Sidestepping your opponent’s clumsy lunge, you slice open his undefended [~BodyPartAll].
14,Your weapon’s flashing arc terminates directly in the enemy’s [~BodyPartAll] with a crunch.
15,You duck underneath your foe’s wild attack, lashing out as your blow connects with her [~BodyPartAll] with a crunch.
16,You hit. He parries. He hits. You parry and you realize he has left himself open... Swipe... HIT!
17,Your blade whistles as it sweeps across the [~BodyPartHigh] of your enemy. A second later, a severed head rolls past your feet.
18,You hear a dull thunk as your axe blade chops into your opponent’s armor. Blood starts seeping from the wound as you extract your gruesome weapon.
19,You deflect a wide swing and take the opportunity to plunge your blade deep into the enemy's [~BodyPartAll]. His eyes bulge before his face goes blank.
20,You feel your blade cut through skin, through muscle, through sinew. Your opponent lets out a scream of pain, but turns away from the blow and strikes back.
21,The foe’s attempt to parry comes too late to stop the blow from making contact.
22,The weapon strikes the foe’s helmet, knocking it to the side and making vision more difficult.
23,You feint to the right before cutting back and slicing a nasty gash into your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll].
24,You thrust into your foe’s [~BodyPartAll] until your blade meets bone. Then with a loud crunch, you push through further.
25,You deflect his attack with your sword and smash his [~BodyPartHigh] with your free hand.
26,Your blade punches through your foe’s armor, and you feel the sickening clunk as it digs into bone. Your foe reels and cries in pain, stumbling backwards and pulling your blade from the wound.
27,Your foe grabs your weapon arm and wrenches it away from him, and you feel tendons burn and twist. But you’re ready, so you grab his hair with a free hand and smash his face into the corner of the table, feeling his nose crack with the impact.
28,A trail of blood follows your blade when you strike at her [~BodyPartAll].
29,With the adrenaline of battle rushing through your mind, you add an unexpected last-second curve to your swing and make full contact with your opponent, slashing diagonally up his [~BodyPartAll].
30,You sidestep with smooth flowing tactics and easily parry an attack. Spinning with precision, you find an opening and thrust your blade up in between armor plating. Your opponent screams out in pain.
31,Your weapon glances off your foe’s [~BodyPartAll], eliciting a grimace of pain and forcing him to turn away slightly.
32,Your opponent falls for a high feint, allowing you to connect solidly with a low swing. Your foe remains standing but will surely have a limp from that one.
33,Your spear punches through your foe’s armour, sinking deep into his stomach before exploding out of his back in a welter of blood, flesh and intestines.
34,Your weapon severs both armor and flesh, releasing a chilling howl from your opponent.
35,You jam your weapon through his foot (pinning it to the floor?).
36,Feinting to the left and low, you quickly reverse your swing and take advantage of the opening you created, slashing your opponent across the [~BodyPartAll].
37,Dodging a hasty swing, you exploit the opening and thrust into your enemy’s [~BodyPartAll].
38,You step aside from a clumsy lunge, spin on your heel and slash open your enemy’s [~BodyPartAll].
39,You knock away his weapon with your shield, drop to your knees, and thrust up into his [~BodyPartAll].
40,You parry a flurry of attacks, then seize the chance for a quick riposte into your foe’s [~BodyPartAll].
41,You beat your opponent’s weapon to the left and then crush his [~BodyPartAll] (nose) with the butt-end of your weapon.
42,You feint high and then slice low at your opponent’s [~BodyPartLow], causing him to wince in pain and stagger.
43,With deft skill your blow snakes past your opponent’s defense and draws his blood!
44,You strike your opponent’s weapon aside and use his own strength against him to drive your weapon home!
45,Even after years of campaigning, the grinding sound of your axe blade successful digging deep into your enemy's [~BodyPartAll] still makes you wince a little. But in this case of finally overcoming the raging foe in front of you, you’re prepared to put up with it.
46,Your punch/weapon connects squarely to his [~BodyPartAll], interrupting his seemingly-endless stream of insults. He staggers backwards, short of breath.
47,As your weapon strikes home, your foe screams involuntarily, “Aaagh! Don’t kill me!”
48,Your weapon lands with a solid THUD on your foe’s armor, clearly dealing damage. Now there’s a good sound!
49,Your blade cleaves the air and flesh, biting deep into your foe’s [~BodyPartAll].
50,With a heavy and meaty thud your weapon rends through your opponent’s body, splitting his flesh and exposing bone.

:RangedAttackSuccess
1,The missile sings through the air, an aria that ends between the ribs of your foe.
2,The target winces in pain as the shot grazes their [~BodyPartAll] and embeds itself in the floor behind.
3,Your bolt slams into your foe with so much force he is staggered by the impact and spins wildly 90-degrees, barely avoiding the blazing brazier behind him.
4,You pick up your bow and swiftly loose an arrow at the foe chasing your compatriot. It’s arc dips too low and pierces the outside of his [~BodyPartLow]. The strike is too high to pierce anything but a little muscle.
5,You spin at the sound, and the knife leaves your fingers as if it had wings. It flies true, but your assailant ducks at the last second, so that the knife buries itself in his shoulder instead of his neck. He glares murder at you but keeps coming.
6,Your shot flies true. It whistles through the air, and punches through your opponent’s armour.
7,Your bolt whistles across the distance with the blur of a hummingbird’s wings and sinks into your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll] with a sickening THWACK!
8,From behind your place of cover, you draw back and fire. Across the din of the battle, your foe never knew what hit him.
9,As your opponent raises his weapon, you pull a flintlock from your belt and loose a round into his [~BodyPartAll].
10,Your dart hits the juncture between two chunks of armor, impaling itself into your opponent’s flesh. Your enemy gasps from the pain, rapidly pulling your dart out of the wound.
11,Despite the crossbow recoil, you manage to at least make the dart fly in a straight line, delivering a glancing blow to your opponent.
12,The first two rounds of your burst thunk into the wooden table your foe has taken cover behind. The third, however, strikes through his [~BodyPartAll] and you can see the bullet hole in the wall behind him.
13,You slowly squeeze the trigger and send your bolt arcing over the melee chaos, striking squarely through an opening in your target’s armor.
14,Your sling whirs as it picks up speed. With a flick of the wrist, you send the stone smacking your target in the [~BodyPartAll] with a solid thunk.
15,Though flying lower than you intended, the missile shatters your opponent’s [~BodyPartLow], pitching him face-first into the ground, unmoving.
16,Your aim is true as your foe doubles over in pain, clutching his stomach in agony, blood collecting in his hands.
17,By the time the TWANG from your bow is heard, an arrow has lodged itself in your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll].
18,The enemy caster raises his hand to deflect your missile with magic, but is too slow. A shrill screech escapes his lips as it pierces his outstretched palm.
19,You curse as your shot goes wide, but your enemy dodges a thrust from a comrade and dances right into your arrow. You hear a yelp of pain as the arrow lodges itself into the enemy’s [~BodyPartAll].
20,You whistle above the din of combat, and your intended target looks up just in time to get an arrow between the eyes ([~BodyPartAll]).
21,He almost doesn’t see it, but he turns at the last second. You graze his cheek, and he yelps with surprise and pain.
22,No, that wasn’t an avalanche, just the cacophony of projectiles raining on your enemies.
23,A loud whistling sound is followed by a scream of agony from the foe.
24,Letting loose with your missile, you listen with satisfaction as the truth of your aim is announced by a painful scream from your opponent.
25,Your assailant looks down and sees the dagger thrust into its [~BodyPartAll]. He gives off a loud roar and bats a limb at it trying to pull it free.
26,Your foe is halted somewhat as the head of your arrow smashes through his [~BodyPartAll]. For the briefest of seconds, he looks calm, as if unharmed, and then erupts in agony.
27,You bring up your weapon, barely having time to aim, and fire on instinct. But you’re lucky, and the shot buries itself in your enemy’s [~BodyPartAll] (gut). He cries out and doubles over in pain, and a flicker of fear enters the eyes of his friends as they watch helplessly.
28,A scream of pain and an angry look tells you hit him well.
29,Your arrow whistles through the air and hits your opponent in the [~BodyPartAll] (chest). He suddenly inhales and staggers to maintain his balance. You see him looking at the ground with a blank stare as he attempts to regain focus on his surroundings.
30,Your opponent grunts deeply with the impact of your impaling arrow. He breaks off the end to avoid any unnecessary restriction to his movement and raises his blade toward you. “Coward! Come and meet my blade.”
31,Your shot pierces your target’s [~BodyPartAll], with both the impact and accompanying cry of pain going unheard amongst the din of battle.
32,Not noticing the incoming missile your target moves directly into its path turning the near miss into a bloody face as it creases his skull and blood erupts.
33,Your shot finds its way to, and through, your target’s throat ([~BodyPartAll]), leaving them gargling blood and clutching at the gushing wound before collapsing.
34,You quickly launch a volley of missiles, raining death onto your target.
35,Watching your foe, you notice he always ducks behind his shield and then pops up on the left to see what happened. Thus you are ready, and your arrow finds the mark the next time he ducks, slicing in and hitting as his [~BodyPartHigh] appears on the left of his shield.
36,You calmly focus on your target, ignore the battle raging around you, and loose your missile into a chink in your target’s armour.
37,Ducking their attacks, you loose at short range and watch your missile strike home.
38,You hold your breath, pause for the perfect opening, then hit your foe square in the [~BodyPartAll] (chest).
39,Your arrow sizzles through the air and embeds itself in your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll].
40,You think you have a head shot lined up, but your opponent throws up a protective arm as the missile streaks towards him, and it pierces his forearm instead. He rips it out with a roar.
41,Your shot draws a bloody furrow across your opponent’s [~BodyPartAll] skin.
42,With a crunch heard across the battle, your strike flies true and leaves your enemy bleeding!
43,The “Whhiiiirrrr!” of your shuriken through the air seems to distract the enemy’s mage even as he begins to cast his spell. But what distracts even more is the pain of it embedding itself in the side of his neck ([~BodyPartHigh]) and the feeling of blood swiftly flowing from the severed artery.
44,CRACK! The bullet strikes your foe’s carapace. For a moment, it seems like the tough armor deflected it – but then, the creature coughs up green, slimy blood. It’s quite injured.
45,The arrow vanishes into the foe’s armor. A second later, rivulets of blood spring forth from the wound.
46,The projectile travels through the enemy’s left foot ([~BodyPartLow]), temporarily pinning him to the ground.
47,Spinning like mad, the hand axe hits your foe’s shield, then skids across its surface, right into his [~BodyPartAll].
48,Peppering your target with long spiked darts, you find the chink in his armor: right below his thigh, you strike him in the knee.
49,In a hail Mary shot, you watch the arrow fly its maximum distance, slowly closing with the running coward. You cheer as the arrow connects with his [~BodyPartAll] (back), sending him reeling and then falling forward, ending his mad dash for escape.
50,Weaving and bobbing, your attempt to circumvent the enemy’s shield is successful as you plant a knife in his [~BodyPartAll].

:AttackMiss
1,You try to bluff your awkward attack as a feint, but no one is buying it.
2,With a mighty grunt, you thrust your spear at your foe’s exposed belly. But with surprising agility, he sidesteps your lunge and you stumble forward, off-balance from your attack.
3,You move in with a sharp flurry of blows, but his sword blocks yours each time with a ringing of steel and sparks. He meets your eyes and smiles slowly.
4,You strike well, but your blow glances off the brute’s well placed armor.
5,The skill of your opponent surprises you as he repeatedly parries your strikes, putting you further off-balance.
6,You lunge through his defense, too quick to be stopped. A tremor is sent up your arm as you realize your blade is blunted and stopped dead on his armor.
7,Even though your mage’s clothing offers little or no protection, you succeed into misdirecting your opponent’s blow, waving your vest to make it difficult to pinpoint your exact location.
8,Thanks to your short stature, your tower-shield completely covers you while the volley of arrows bounces off the shield’s metallic surface.
9,You make several wild swings at your opponent, and he deftly dodges backward from your unskilled blows, a wry grin appearing on his face. But you know better, having scouted this clearing before the battle. He has backed himself into wet grass and unsure footing.
10,Your overzealous lunge is deftly sidestepped by your dexterous opponent.
11,Your opponent smashes the edge of his shield into your weapon, narrowly deflecting your blow.
12,Your grip on your weapon falters, almost imperceptibly. You recover gracefully, making it seem like a toying swipe.
13,Your weapon rings in your hand as your foe brings up his defense just in time.
14,You slash with your sword. CLANG! You hit him square in his chestplate. No damage.
15,The whirling melee seems to slow to a crawl as your opponent’s weapon arcs toward you. You pull back at the last moment, and the blade slashes a line in your clothing.
16,You slice towards your opponent with an overhead chop, but it’s deflected to the side at the last moment. Your enemy kicks your weapon away and grins triumphantly.
17,The enemy dodges out of the way just in time, and your weapon pierces an empty barrel. The enemies turn and snicker as you attempt to extract your weapon.
18,You swing low, but he skips lightly backwards, calmly scanning for an opening he can use.
19,Just as practiced, the blow lands firmly on the enemy’s shield, causing no damage.
20,The attack was sound. No contact, no damage, just sound.
21,Something wet underfoot causes you to slip, and your thrust finds nothing but fresh air.
22,Fortune favors the bold, and so it seems that fortune favored the creature for daring to stand against you as your shot narrowly sails wide. Try again and make the creature’s luck run out.
23,The foes on either side of you thrust with expert synchronization, but you twist sideways between their weapons and they barely avoid skewering each other.
24,With a blow that would fell a man cleanly, you overstep your mark and miss, taking a massive splintering chunk out of the tree to the side. With a grin, your foe rights himself and makes for his counter attack.
25,You swing your weapon but your enemy desperately bashes it away as hard as he can, and you feel the shock pass down through it, into the bones of your arm. It aches, but you keep on fighting.
26,Dodging your blow, your opponent adjusts the grip on his blade while glaring at you: “So close.”
27,A spark flies from the strike of your two blades. “Ha, ha!” your opponent retorts confidently. “You missed.”
28,You raise your sword to block the brute’s overhead swing, but he lets out a roar and puts everything he has into it. He bashes your blade aside.
29,Your swing ends with a clash of steel as your foe’s blade darts up to intercept yours. A mouthful of disgusting teeth leer at you as your opponent gives you a mocking grin beneath the locked blades.
30,Your opponent spins away from your well-placed swing with only the strain in their face showing how close to connecting you came.
31,You put all your weight into the swing when one foot slips, the momentum turning you. Your swing ends nowhere near your opponent, who seems as surprised by that as you are.
32,Your opponent smiles through rotten teeth, drooling at the prospect of his next attack.
33,At the last moment his sword flicks up and parries your attack.
34,Your target leaves himself open. But as you lunge forward, his weapon appears from nowhere and parries the attack. He grins at you with feral anticipation.
35,Your opponent raises their shield to absorb your attack, sending shock waves up your arm.
36,The opponent reads the attack in your eyes and easily deflects the blow.
37,Your attack slides past his shield, only to bounce off his sturdy armour.
38,Your opponent dances nimbly out of reach, laughing at your crude lunge.
39,As you charge forward, your opponent steps inside your reach at precisely the right moment, grasps your right arm in a spinning throw, and slings you over his hip. Somehow, you manage to land on your feet.
40,You see an opening and strike, but your opponent twists away from your blow and spins full circle, jamming into your side with weapon raised.
41,Your foe slips away from your strike, and you find yourself overextended.
42,You swing confidently at your foe, but your foot slips and you flail wildly for balance. Your enemy grins at you.
43,With urgent speed and deft finesse, your rapier twists in the air as your opponent lunges wildly at you with her cutlass. With confident skill you deflect each blow at the last moment, and now you are poised to strike back with deadly effect.
44,He parries your attack like you’re hitting a wall. You almost bounce back from the sheer force – this guy is strong!
45,The enemy nimbly jumps out of the way. He continues jumping around, chanting, “Watch me dance! Watch me dance!
46,The blow ends a few inches short of impact. The enemy taunts you, saying, “Ha! Nice try!
47,You gotta love fighting defensively. Your foes can’t seem to get their bearings on you as you show off your fancy footwork.
48,The riposte is your thing. First you make sure his weapon is out of the way, then you utilize the opening.
49,Parry, duck, raise shield, let the blow slide off to the side.
50,The wild duel this round ends in a bind of swords!

:SpellAttack
1,A bolt of energy screams towards your target. But it seems to fizzle and shrink in on itself as it goes. In the end, the impact is marked only by a hissing sound and a small grunt.
2,The sickly green orb you’ve conjured hurtles towards your foe, smashing into him, like a wave upon the rocks, absolutely drenching him in acid. He lets out a howl of pain as tendrils of smoke steam from his bubbling armor and skin.
3,“Vah bein sha’bannah!” The end of the incantation echoes through the hall. Your foe stops short, jerking his body unnaturally. He doubles over and a gentle glow begins to emanate from his body. It brightens for the next few moments, and his cry of surprise becomes an annoyed “meow!” The light dims and in his place is a small calico cat, sunning himself in the light coming through the window.
4,Arcane words and light reach a crescendo in your hands. With a whisper of your will, you unleash the power as a lightning bolt sizzles through the air to make your enemies dance and die.
5,The arcane power surges from your body, leaving the tips of your fingers tingling as it mangles your foe.
6,You stand with your hands raised in expectation as you finish your invocation. As the last syllable leaves your lips, a second of silence fills the air around you. You feel your clothing subtly shift and raise off your skin by a fraction of an inch. Then a loud ZZZZZZZT! fills the air as you feel a ball of energy gather and rush from between your outstretched hands. Although you see nothing, your enemy drops to his knees, roaring in agony as blood pools in his eye sockets. He begins to vomit black bile and gore.
7,Tracing the runes, you beckon the ethereal forces to do your bidding. With a crack, they rip into your opponent, turning his insides into hamburger.
8,Arcs of lightning streak from your fingers, engulfing your opponent and sending him into convulsive spasms.
9,Your spell flies through the air towards your enemy, hitting him over and over, every strike sapping your opponent’s strength as the negative energy drains him.
10,Resisting the urge to blow the whole door with your disintegration, you aim the green ray directly through the lock, guiding it to the guard behind it. With a mischievous smile, you wave your hand to the thief, now free to pick the lock, the door now guarded only by a small pile of dust.
11,The thick black grease you conjured covers the floor directly in front of your charging foe. Seeing this, he attempts to vault over the mess. Rather unsuccessfully. He falsely times his jump and ends up face down in black gunk.
12,You lower your hand to witness the carnage wrought by your mere gesture and utterance. The smell of burnt flesh assails your nostrils as you gaze at the charred, smoking bodies left in the wake of your power.
13,As the orbs of energy leave your hand, you laugh as your target desperately tries to take cover, moments too late. The orbs unerringly seek him out and are painfully absorbed into his body.
14,The ray leaps from your hand, strikes your foe and traces a crooked, briefly glowing line across your foe’s chest. A scent of singed flesh assaults your senses.
15,Your hands trace symbols of power through the air. They flash for a moment before fizzling back into the void. Your foe clutches their head in agony, defenseless before your mental assault.
16,Sizzling yellow light envelops your arm. It forms a bolt that flies forth and strikes true.
17,Your opponent stands mesmerized by your hand movements and hypnotic speech. He looks confused for a second, and then his eyes start darting back and forth as your spell of paranoia takes effect.
18,As you finish your arcane chant, you thrust your hand towards your foe in a grasping motion. Tendrils of smoke ooze forth and wrap around your enemy’s throat.
19,Your arcane mutterings slowly drift away on the wind towards your target. A second later, you hear him scream and fall to the ground, clutching his ears and rolling on the ground.
20,This is a spell you know well. You don’t even think of the words any more as they shape the fabric of reality, to your opponent’s terror.
21,He must have been a violator because he just got TOAD.
22,The dance of spell gestures is followed by a motion similar to tossing a ball. The recipient does not look too happy....
23,With practiced movement of your hands and appropriate words, you summon the magical energy you require before unleashing it at your opponent, causing him to cry out in pain.
24,Neither Elmo’s Fire nor Zeus’ Thunderbolt could tear through the creature like your spell just did. Your foe flails in pain and terror as your spell takes its life force away.
25,Arcs of lightning streak from your fingers, engulfing your opponent and sending him into convulsive spasms.
26,The sounds of battle fade, replaced by comforting chanting. You slump to the ground, asleep almost before the mage turns his glowing gaze on the rest of the party.
27,The air around you goes oily and metallic as the arcane energies spurt from your fingertips to arrive writhing and sizzling in the center of your opponent’s chest. The smell of ozone and charred meat is only outmatched by the wailing that emits from his lips.
28,You close your eyes and feel the golden threads of magic weaving through the world, sending your consciousness spiralling down one thread. You open your eyes, and with a noise of glass breaking, the spell springs into being and discharges into your enemy’s chest, sending him flying.
29,A twisting greenish ray hits your opponent with a screeching sound. You see the armor and skin starting to melt off your opponent.
30,Concentrating on a fixed point, you complete the incantation and watch the exploding effect consume your opponent. They cry out in pain from the intensity of the energy.
31,With blinding speed the flash of energy erupts upon your target in a brilliant flare. Smoke rises from the sizzle of the blackened scorch mark of the wound.
32,Coruscating energy engulfs your target momentarily. As it dissipates you can see a satisfying vacant expression on their face.
33,Eldritch energy streams from your fingertips and slams into your foe, their cry of anguish dwindling as they fall backwards, nerves afire.
34,The fireball leaps from your hands and flames explode outward as it strikes amongst your foes, leaving burned skin, blackened armour, pain filled cries and the smell of cooked meat in its wake.
35,The hair on the back of your neck stands at attention as the energy discharges from your fingertips into the target, doubling him over in pain.
36,Your spell stops your opponent’s movement and its eyes grow big as its jaw drops open.
37,You chant the words of power and your fingertips glow with energy, causing your target to writhe with pain.
38,A hollow pop sounds as you bring your fingers together in the proper somatic order. A flash of orange energy culminates in an explosion of flame at your target.
39,Mana surges through your body as you harness the elements to your command. The target is shrouded in a burst of arcane energy.
40,A wave of eldritch power bursts from your fingers and envelops your target.
41,Sidestepping a clumsy blow, you discharge your spell straight into their face.
42,That is the worst magic I’ve seen since Eron the Toothless cast Attack of the Collywobbles on a Death Elemental!
43,As the detonation of your spell echoes off the walls, you see the target writhing in agony.
44,Echoes of your incantation reverberate throughout the room before converging on your unfortunate target’s eardrums.
45,The confident grin on your opponent’s face fades to uncertainty and fear as the very air around him starts to energize.
46,Eldritch energies reach out and caress your foe, sending them reeling.
47,With visible effort, you control the energies you have just unleashed upon your poor, pitiable foe.
48,The buzz of arcane energy that courses through your skull when casting a spell always gives you a rush. The blast of cold air and cracking sound of frozen skin as the fire giant attempts to escape the ice storm just adds a hint of spice to the moment.
49,The enemy screams in pain as he’s set ablaze, and the air is filled with the stench of burnt hair.
50,You finish the incantation and toss the magical energy at your enemy. The writhing and screaming verify the spell worked as planned.
51,As the staff points at the enemy, he reels backward from the spell’s impact.
52,Dancing to a thunderous roar, the lightning strike makes your targets spasm involuntarily before they drop to the ground, burned and electrocuted.
53,With a malignant burning light in your eye, you smile as the former guards slowly turn towards you and bow stiffly, uttering a forced, “Your wish is our command.”
54,It starts as a low whisper, but the volume steadily increases to a high pitch whistle. Fiery meteors streak down, sprinkling the target area with craters. Debris is tossed around as shrapnel, and explosive shock waves collide between impacts. Your enemies are devastated by the barrage.
55,Your foe seems to be no stranger to magic missiles. As the first one hits, he starts scanning around for the offending mage!

1,If your skill were half as sharp as your blade I might feel threatened. If your wit were half as sharp as your skill I might feel insulted. I’ll wager neither has seen a whetstone in months.
1,You call that a sword? That’s not a sword - THIS is a sword!
1,Your foe lifts his weapon high above his shoulders. “Now you will hear our demands! You and your people will leave immediately! If you stay, you will face us in battle. And if you face us in battle, then by high summer, we will strew the mourning sod of this forsaken land with your bleeding corpses!” “Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!”

1,I’ll oil my blade with your blood, and gamble with your bones.
1,You think I am afraid to die? What is life but suffering? No, friend, I welcome Death though Death has refused my embrace too many times. Perhaps she will welcome you more kindly!
1,You hit like a girl! Oh-wait! You are a girl!
1,Bring some friends, I’ll wait.
1,Even if someone likes it hot, nobody likes it THAT hot!
1,My grandmother hits harder than you, and she’s dead! Well, actually, being a vampire may give her some advantage, but let’s not dwell upon the details.
1,When you speak it sounds like an accident. Please stop.
1,Your life is about to become like a halfling vampire: short and sucky.
1,You leave your defenses wide open - like your mom leaves her legs.
1,You come bearing weapons, children? I accept these gifts, that I may bestow them upon the least of my minions. As a token of goodwill, I will not even require you to grovel upon your way out.
1,The monster’s roar resounds through the air, echoing off walls and ear-drums before settling in your heart....
1,You couldn’t hit water if you were on a boat!
1,You filth! I’ll send you back to your people in PIECES!
1,I’ll cleave your skull to the teeth!
1,Everyone I’ve faced in battle is visiting their gods. Above and below, they tell stories of my prowess.
1,Ha! For a gnat railing against powers he has no comprehension of, that was impressive! Let me offer this simple riposte.
1,Aye, come to me, and prove your mother had children who lived!
1,What do you call that? I’ve seen better attempts from babes-in-arms!
1,Come at me, rogue!
1,The enemy pulls your arrow out of his thigh and nocks it to his own longbow, wincing slightly. “This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it did me!”
1,Your foe spits out a gobbet of phlegm and blood, screaming, “I shall stamp you down as I’d stamp a mouse!”
1,I do love what you’re wearing; it’ll be a shame to kill you. Still, let us hope red goes with that outfit.
1,I’ll bet your mother was poultry, you little chicken.
1,Your opponent looks at you with battle rage, saying, “At least make it challenging for me.”
1,Is that your best? Maybe they should have sent someone with real skill!
1,Come and fight me you miserable son of a whore.
1,My dead grandmother could put up more of a fight than you.
1,Is that the best you can do? I’ve been hit harder by a three year- old girl.
1,Are you just going to stand there and look ugly, or are you going to fight?
1,Oh how I pity you. You have no idea in how much danger you are.
1,I’ve seen goblins hit harder than that!
1,Your opponent grins at you revealing a large gap where one of his front teeth used to be, “Oh ho, boyo! Now I will skewer you and roast you over a fire like the suckling pig you are!”

1,Run back to Mama and send me a real warrior!
1,My toothless grandma had more bite than that last blow!
1,Your opponent mutters, “I’m not being paid enough for this.”
1,Surrender now and save yourself the embarrassment of fighting me and proving yourself inferior!
1,With an evil grin, your opponent draws his weapon and cuts a shallow line across his chest. Then he smears the blood across the blade and points it at you!
1,I’ve grown used to Lord Turlan sending fluff-cheeked boys to face adults, armed with toys when only the tools of war will save them. But I did not expect your snivelling, cringing master to send a pompous, cowardly popinjay to challenge me when a brave and honest opponent might have earned my mercy in defeat. Contempt doesn’t begin to describe how I feel for both him and you as you start on your short path to death.
1,Your defeat is a mathematical certainty, adventurers. My vastly superior mind has gone through this battle many times over, and I assure you: there is no circumstance under which you can win. Spare us all the trouble and surrender now.
