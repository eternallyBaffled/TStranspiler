#  Tarot Character Tool
#  
#  This tool uses the interpretation of Tarot cards (specifically
#  those of the Rider-Waite-deck) to come up with rather nice NPC
#  descriptions.
#
#  The "Shadow" is a dark side, which is great to reveal after some
#  time, when the PCs already know the Self (and especially those 
#  sides the NPC shows others) sufficiently well.
#  
#  The skill fields were chosen with the assupmtions that these
#  fields were present in any RPG:
#
#  Combat (Wands): Weapon skills, siege, artillery and the like.
#  Physical (Pentacles: Real physical skills like swimming, jumping,
#            but also crafts and many art forms.
#  Intellectual (Swords): Knowledge or lore skills, languages and spells.
#  Social (Cups): Streetwise, Etiquette, Lying and similar skills, also
#            poetry and music.
#
#  The fields were chosen due to the meaning, not by expressions in
#  language (just to explain why swords are not combat etc.)
#  
#  The table really inspires me, and enables me to give each tiny
#  (unimportant?) NPC a story and the possibility to gain greater
#  influence throughout the game.
#  
#  One last note:
#
#  For those of you who despise of Tarot for this or that reason:
#  It is but a game, a tool which allows humans to get a glimpse
#  upon the "world soul" (cf. "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho).
#  For those of you who like Tarot but despise of the use for
#  roleplay: It is but a game.
#
#  Have fun, all of you. And keep in mind the comment at the end
#  of the output.

# Modified by Valminder, Feb 2006.
#    Adapted for TSv5.
#    Added a slight modification to the subtables social,
#       combat, intellectual, physical, where a complete
#       list of numebrs is required from 1 to XX (ex: 1-36,)
#       to display the correct card information.

1,(The Fool)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is a naive guy, walking through the world as a child would. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is always open for new experiences and drinks them in as if they were ambrosia.

4,(The Empress)<br>The motherly type, indeed. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} seeks growth for [g3=%mf%] and the people around [g4=%mf%]. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is quite a creative person, without being lofty.
5,(The Emperor)<br>The fatherly type, indeed. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} likes [g2=%mf%] things in order, appreciates rules and safety and will demand discipline by followers and friends.

14,(Death)<br>Death accompanies this [g0=%mf%] wherever [g1=%mf%] goes. Probably lost important people as a child, [g1=%mf%] won't cling to anything to tight, in fear it might come to an end. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} future seems dull and grey to [g4=%mf%].

21,(Judgement)<br>A deep, deep [g0=%mf%] who is serious but kind and strives to gain a deeper understanding of the world. {If~{Dice~1d20}>16?Might eventually reach enlightenment.}
22,(The World)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} has understood a lot about the world and is very content with it. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} company is balm for the soul, and [g1=%mf%] exudes harmony and happiness alike.
23,(Ace of Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} carries great love for [g2=%mf%] surroundings, be it persons, things or deeds. A sincere happiness radiates from [g4=%mf%].

27,(V Cups)<br>Sorrowful one. All hopes are gone from the mind of this pitiful [g0=%mf%].

29,(VII Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} tends to be overly enthusiastic, loosing [g3=%mf%] in illusionary thoughts.
30,(VIII Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} has left something very important, and the farewell has not at all been easy.
31,(IX Cups)<br>A very content, humourous and jolly [g0=%mf%]. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} looks on the bright side of life indeed!

37,(Ace of Wands)<br>A lively person, striving and motivated. No sunny day without a trip for this [g0=%mf%]!
38,(II Wands)<br>A rather neutral [g0=%mf%], almost lethargic. Will not side with anything quickly.
39,(III Wands)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} walks the safe path, and walks it well. A business[g0=%mf%] that plans in advance.
40,(IV Wands)<br>An open and jolly [g0=%mf%], polite and welcoming.

43,(VII Wands)<br>A jealous person who tends to fight and argue. Holds grudges against many, and sympathy for few.
44,(VIII Wands)<br>Bears good messages! Always there to lift the spirits of people with surprising news and tales.
45,(IX Wands)<br>A perfectionist, sullen and defiant, often wrong-headed and unwilling to gain insights.
46,(X Wands)<br>This [g0=%mf%] is almost crushed by [g2=%mf%] responsibility, and is short of losing [g2=%mf%] hopes.

50,(King of Wands)<br>Dynamic and strong-minded, this [g0=%mf%] goes where [g1=%mf%] likes. Enjoys leadership. {If~%mf%=2?She is rather masculine}
51,(Ace of Swords)<br>This level-headed [g0=%mf%] keeps the distance, but is clever and critical. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} inspects everything skeptically.
52,(II Swords)<br>Doubtful as this [g0=%mf%] is, gaining [g2=%mf%] trust is very difficult. A certain despair seems to stick to [g4=%mf%].
53,(III Swords)<br>Heartsick, oh so heartsick. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} disappointment and sadness almost make you cry, too.
54,(IV Swords)<br>An ascetic. Keeps from many things that others may consider important - to [g4=%mf%], it is just a waste of energy.
55,(V Swords)<br>A heartless and destructive [g0=%mf%]. His dastardly deeds overshadow all his personality.
56,(VI Swords)<br>Unrooted but daring, this [g0=%mf%] is quick to start new projects, as the former ones did not fit [g2=%mf%] taste any longer.
57,(VII Swords)<br>A cunning and guile [g0=%mf%]. You're never sure when and if [g1=%mf%] tells the truth.

59,(IX Swords)<br>Plagued by nightmares of guilt and remorse, this [g0=%mf%] constantly martyrs [g3=%mf%].

62,(Knight of Swords)<br>A cool and distanced [g0=%mf%], calculating and sometimes belligerent.

:shadow
1,(The Fool)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} just can't take responsibility. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} will flee it, if [g1=%mf%] can, or abandon any duty given to [g4=%mf%].
2,(The Magician)<br>A charlatan. A "Make-Believe" kind of person, that is fascinating, but might well betray you. Might.
3,(The High Priestess)<br>Very wayward, not quite "here", in reality. May have medial qualities, and will certainly be talking a lot.
4,(The Empress)<br>A certain greed sticks to this [g4=%mf%], and also [g1=%mf%] is rather unpredictable in [g2=%mf%] arbitrariness.
5,(The Emperor)<br>Despotic and oppressive, quick to anger and hard to calm. "Feeling" is not a word [g1=%mf%] could spell right.
6,(The Hierophant)<br>A hypocrite, proclaiming principles [g1=%mf%] may or may not heed. Also arrogant at times and insincere.
7,(The Lovers)<br>An indecisive [g0=%mf%]. Has obviously chosen wrong once too often, and won't stick to any choice now.
8,(The Chariot)<br>A sort of megalomania clings to [g4=%mf%] like the beard to a dwarf. Ruthless to a certain degree.
9,(Strength)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is brutal and cruel at times, and will usually be immoderate and excessive.
10,(The Hermit)<br>The world never meant much to [g4=%mf%], and thus [g1=%mf%] sought isolation. Now [g1=%mf%] is quite a codger, with few hobbies and fewer friends.
11,(The Wheel of Fortune)<br>A fatalist. Fears to develop, gives up easily.
12,(Justice)<br>Prejudices mark this [g4=%mf%] as clearly as darkness marks the night. Too selfsure, too subjective.
13,(The Hanged Man)<br>The crisis [g1=%mf%] is in seems to swallow [g4=%mf%] whole. But for some reason, [g1=%mf%] doesn't do anything about it.
14,(Death)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} just won't evolve. Be it fear or inability, this [g0=%mf%] is not likely to start living as [g1=%mf%] should.
15,(Temperance)<br>A lazy and uneven [g0=%mf%], rather bourgeois. Ambivalence is a sad state of mind, choosing extremes whenever possible is an annyoing habit.
16,(The Devil)<br>This [g0=%mf%] has seen the dark side. Temptation was always strong for [g4=%mf%], and more than once [g1=%mf%] could not resist. Dependency and vice were close to [g4=%mf%] all [g2=%mf%] life.
17,(The Tower)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} lost all [g1=%mf%] had, and due to that has also lost part of [g2=%mf%] self. {Cap~[g1=%mf%]} can't stand relying on anything that could vanish again and has become cruel and destructive.
18,(The Star)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} will always be sure that any task imposed upon [g4=%mf%] might just as well be approached the next day. And the next, and the next,...
19,(The Moon)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is haunted by terrible fears, that sometimes even penetrate [g2=%mf%] sleep and send [g4=%mf%] nightmares. Easy to scare, this poor [g0=%mf%] never feels really safe.
20,(The Sun)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} terribly overestimates [g3=%mf%] at times and is a real swank. It seems [g1=%mf%] does all that to plaster [g2=%mf%] barren and boring self.
21,(Judgement)<br>This poor [g0=%mf%] is captive in [g2=%mf%] own web of self-deception. Also has a tendency to live in the past.
22,(The World)<br>Goes errant in the world, has lost [g2=%mf%] path and is not able to find it again.
23,(Ace of Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} has little love for all around [g4=%mf%]. As [g1=%mf%] does not show it, [g1=%mf%] is really quite a hypocrite.
24,(II Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is likely to pretend to like you, though [g1=%mf%] really doesn't. Personal relations are not [g2=%mf%] hobby...
25,(III Cups)<br>Eager [g1=%mf%] is, but usually a little too quick about [g2=%mf%] successes, or not honest in [g2=%mf%] joy.
26,(IV Cups)<br>{Cap~[g0=%mf%]} is constantly in a bad mood, as if the world itself were insulting [g4=%mf%].
27,(V Cups)<br>Sorrowful one. All hopes are gone from the mind of this pitiful [g0=%mf%].
28,(VI Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} cannot let go of the old times and is therefore lost in memories of better times. That way, [g1=%mf%] flees the world.
29,(VII Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} has no strong relation to reality and won't see things clearly, even if they are straight ahead. {If~{Dice~1d20}>15?Is also a visionary, a medium!}
30,(VIII Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is never really home. Constantly seeking and constantly frustrated not to find what [g1=%mf%]'s looking for made this [g0=%mf%]'s heart heavy.
31,(IX Cups)<br>Subject to gluttony and craving for pleasure is this smug [g0=%mf%].
32,(X Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is not a very agreeable person, seeks arguments and is pretty fuddy-duddy.
33,(Page of Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is a pretender who is not to count on. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} shifting loyalties make [g4=%mf%] all but trustworthy.
34,(Knight of Cups)<br>A cunning and ambigous [g0=%mf%], sometimes sentimental and often a bootlicker.
35,(Queen of Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is a depraved and vicious [g0=%mf%] without honor.
36,(King of Cups)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is a charlatan, [g2=%mf%] words and deeds often duplicitous and evil.
37,(Ace of Wands)<br>An active [g0=%mf%], hot-tempered and rash, often overly ambitious.
38,(II Wands)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is faint-hearted and undecided, never one to frame [g2=%mf%] opinios aloud.
39,(III Wands)<br>Lost in dreams of a splendid future, this [g0=%mf%] is a bit lofty.
40,(IV Wands)<br>{Cap~[g1=%mf%]} is a snob, only pretending to be tolerant and open.
41,(V Wands)<br>Constantly challenging and fighting, there is never peace with this [g0=%mf%], who often tricks [g2=%mf%] opponents, too.
42,(VI Wands)<br>Boasting is [g2=%mf%] middle name, as it seems. Premature in decisions and when it comes down to it, very close to a coward.
43,(VII Wands)<br>A jealous person who tends to fight and argue. Holds grudges against many, and sympathy for few.
44,(VIII Wands)<br>A premature [g0=%mf%] who wastes [g2=%mf%] energy for the wrong entertainment, if you catch my meaning.
45,(IX Wands)<br>A perfectionist, sullen and defiant, often wrong-headed and unwilling to gain insights.
46,(X Wands)<br>This [g0=%mf%] is crushed by [g2=%mf%] responsibility, and, due to that, has lost all hope.
47,(Page of Wands)<br>{Cap~[g2=%mf%]} tendency to take risks makes [g4=%mf%] hard to cope with. Often leads [g2=%mf%] friends astray, wether willing or not.
48,(Knight of Wands)<br>An eager [g0=%mf%], quick to take risks, impatient and hot-blooded.
49,(Queen of Wands)<br>Dramatic and temperamental [g1=%mf%]is, but also a mistrusting and cunning [g0=%mf%]. {If~%mf%=1?He is rather feminine}
50,(King of Wands)<br>This dare-devil just <i>must</i> have the command, and [g1=%mf%] will strive for it without consideration. {If~%mf%=2?She is rather masculine}
51,(Ace of Swords)<br>This cold-hearted as well as cold blooded [g0=%mf%] keeps [g2=%mf%] distance to people, because [g1=%mf%] bears skepticism towards anything.
52,(II Swords)<br>A certain despair clings to this doubtful as well as dubious [g0=%mf%].
53,(III Swords)<br>Heartsick, oh so heartsick. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} disappointment and sadness almost make you cry, too.
54,(IV Swords)<br>"The world has turned, and left me here". What better way to describe this [g0=%mf%]'s darker side. 
55,(V Swords)<br>A heartless and destructive [g0=%mf%]. {Cap~[g2=%mf%]} dastardly deeds overshadow all [g2=%mf%] personality.
56,(VI Swords)<br>A vagabond in [g2=%mf%] heart, [g1=%mf%] is constantly alert and ready to leave. Won't stick to one cause for long.
57,(VII Swords)<br>A cunning and guile [g0=%mf%]. You're never sure when and if [g1=%mf%] tells the truth.
58,(VIII Swords)<br>Too controlled and severe [g0=%mf%], tyrannised by [g2=%mf%] own rules and principles.
59,(IX Swords)<br>Plagued by nightmares of guilt and remorse, this [g0=%mf%] constantly martyrs [g3=%mf%].
60,(X Swords)<br>This [g0=%mf%] has left all behind with a violent farewell. Abrupt and arbitrary [g1=%mf%] left [g2=%mf%] former self behind.
61,(Page of Swords)<br>Arguments, nothing but arguments with this vile and insincere [g0=%mf%].
62,(Knight of Swords)<br>A cool and distanced [g0=%mf%]. A show-off, uncautious and sometimes belligerent.
63,(Queen of Swords)<br>A cynic, cold-blooded and calculating. {If~%mf%=1?He is rather feminine}
64,(King of Swords)<br>A repelling [g0=%mf%], cynical and sadistic, sometimes cruel. {If~%mf%=2?She is rather masculine}
65,(Ace of Pentacles)<br>A greedy and closefisted materialist. Unenjoyable company, even less enjoyable trading partner.
66,(II Pentacles)<br>{Cap~[g2=%mf%]} joy is only pretended, and the moods of this careless [g0=%mf%] are shifting as the tides. 
67,(III Pentacles)<br>A haughty and presumptuous [g0=%mf%], silly and dull.
68,(IV Pentacles)<br>A closefisted niggard, always afraid for [g2=%mf%] well-being. Will always choose the safest possible path.
