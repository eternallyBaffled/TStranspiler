# Shop & Owner Description
#
# Source 1: TSR 9262 - Cities of Mystery (Disposition, Motivation, Quality)
# Source 2: Dawn Ibach (she made the wonderful Quirks table used here --
#                        I hope she doesn't mind.)
# Source 3: Myself (shop types).
# Send additions to JimmyFlowers@bigfoot.com
#
# DM must determine sex of shop owner.
# Inns and Taverns are much better handled by other tables. 
#
# Modified by Valminder, April 2002.
#   I transfered the "Shop" to "Miscellaneous.Shop" AND "Quirks" to
#   "Miscellaneous.Quirks" so they could be used by other tables.
#
#   I also added links to:
#         Creatures.Humanoid2
#         Miscellaneous.Gender
#         Names Generator.NAME Random
#         NPC Appearance.NPC
#
# Valminder, Feb 2004: created "Generate" subtable.
#   -Added customers.
#   -Added staff.
#    (Cut/paste staff in the new shop table and modify the variables
#     Assistant1 / Assistant2 / Assistant3 and make sure to include all the variables
#     below)
#
# Modified by Valminder, Jan 2006.
#    Adapted for TSv5.
