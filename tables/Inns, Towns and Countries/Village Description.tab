# I honestly can't remember I I was the author of this Table or if someone else created it but 
# I know that I did work on this mainly because I loved this type of Table generation
# I recently discovered this on the Yahoo Groups files section and fixed it up a bit
# With the vast array of tables out the atm I sure that Tablesmith user might not have all the referenced material
# for this table.  Let me know and I'll try to add everything into one zip file.
# Thanks Bruce for a magnificent piece of software...It's come a long way from the gem
