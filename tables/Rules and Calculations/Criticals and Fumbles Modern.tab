:DD_Explanations
1,<b><u>Critical Hit</u>:</b> A threat is made as per the normal rules from the <i>Modern Rules</i>. If the threat roll hits the target again, a critical hit is scored and the attacker rolls 1d100 in the appropriate table: blunt, piercing, or slashing.<br>
_<u>Optional Rule</u>: If, on the threat roll, the attacker hits the target and gets another threat, he must roll again for an extra critical hit. If this second threat hits the target, the critical hit is much better, and the damage are multiplied by x2 (as per the rules, if it was x2 it becomes x3). The attacker continues like this as long as he gets a threat and hits the target with the threat. Roll only once in the critical hit table.<br><br>
_<b><u>Critical Hits: Special Effects</b></u> (-2 penalties)<br>
_<b>Arm:</b> Climb and Swim; attack rolls and Strength.<br>
_<b>Hand:</b> Alchemy, Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Forgery, Heal, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Use Rope; attack rolls.<br>
_<b>Eye (1):</b> Appraise, Alchemy, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Open Lock, Read Lips, Scry, Search, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Spot, Wilderness Lore (track only); initiative; Dex checks; Reflex saves. Blind if both eyes.<br>
_<b>Ear (1):</b> Listen; initiative. Deaf if both ears.<br>
_<b>Feet/Leg:</b> Balance, Climb, Jump, Move Silently, Ride, Swim, Tumble; Dex checks, Reflex saves.<br>
_<b>Head:</b> Attack rolls, all saving throws, all other checks.<br><br>
_<b>Example</b>: If the "Primary arm (weapon) struck" critical hit is rolled, the target suffers a -2 penalty on its attack rolls, Climb and Swim checks, and its Strength score.<br><br>
_<u>Until Healed</u>: all the damage received from a critical hit must be healed to prevent the special effects of this critical hit. (Example: For the "Chest injuries (death in 2d4 rounds)" critical hit, all damage from this critical hit must be healed or death will happen in 2d4 rounds, even if only 1 hit point was not restored.)"<br><br>

:Fumble_Explanations
1,<br><br><b><u>Fumble:</b></u><br>
_A <i>fumble</i> is obtained when a natural "1" si rolled on any attack roll. This has 2 effects:<br>
_1- All attacks after the "1", in the same action (not for AoO made later in the round), are cancelled. So, a "1" on an AoO cancels only this AoO.<br>
_2- The attacker rolls 1d100 in the fumble table and suffers the consequences.<br><br>
_Note: if the critical hit or the fumble result rolled does not apply (ex: the target does not have a shield), the critical hit is made normally or there is no other effects from the fumble, except losing the attacks after the "1".<br>

1,<b><u>Misfire</u>:</b> {Color~Blue,Concentration DC 15}.
_<br>This check represents how carefully you loaded your firearm and how methodically you have cleaned, repaired, and maintained the weapon over time.
_<br><u>Repair 5+ ranks</u>: {Color~Green,+2 Concentration vs Misfire}.
_<br>DC Modifier
_<br>{Color~Red,+2}[Tab]Percussion firearm / Flintlock firearm
_<br>{Color~Red,+2}[Tab]Unreliable firearm <i>(poorly maintained firearm, poorly designed firearm, firearm older than 20 years, cheap knock-off)</i>

_<br>{Color~Red,var}[Tab]Unfamiliar firearm <i>(For firearms not loaded or maintained by the firing character, the GM should feel free to set the DC.)</i>
_<br><br>{Color~Green,<u>Success</u>:} <b>Dud.</b> The primer either doesn't fire or fails to ignite the main charge of powder.
_<br>[Tab]-Percussion or Flintlock: The percussion cap or priming-powder fails to ignite the main charge. Although the weapon remains loaded, the cap or priming-powder needs to be replaced before the ammunition may be discharged. This requires a move action to accomplish by itself, or occurs automatically during reloading.
_<br>[Tab]-Metallic Cartridge: The primer fails and the bullet must be completely replaced. Removing the dud round is no trickier than removing a spent casing, happening automatically during reloading or whenever a spent casing would be ejected normally by the lever or pump action of the weapon.
_<br><br>{Color~Red,<u>Failure by 1-4</u>:} <b>Jam.</b> The ammunition not only fails to fire, but becomes jammed in the barrel or breech. Clearing the jam requires a Repair or DEX check.
_<br>[Tab]<u>Percussion or Flintlock</u>: Revolving breech (DC15;4 FULL); Breechloader (DC15;4 FULL); Muzzleloader (DC20;1 hour).
_<br>[Tab]<u>Metallic Cartridge</u>: Revolving breech (DC10;2 FULL); Breechloader (DC10;2 FULL); Repeating longarm (DC10;2 FULL); Gatling gun (DC10;4 FULL).
_<br>[Tab]Removing jammed ammunition from a percussion revolver or breechloader typically involves boring into the ammunition and pulling it out using special tools. Muzzleloaders must be disassembled to remove a jam. When metallic cartridge ammunition becomes jammed due to swelling relative to the barrel, the shell must be pried or bored free.
_<br>[Tab]The continued functionality of a jammed weapon also depends on the type of firearm, as indicated by the following:
_<br>[Tab][Tab]-<u>Pepperbox (pistol or longarm) or Revolver</u>: Only the chamber with the dud cannot be reloaded until the jam is cleared. The remaining chambers can still be reloaded and fired normally; however, each time the jammed ammunition comes up in the firing sequence, the shooter must advance the cylinder or firing pin to the next chamber. For a pepperbox this requires a move action; for a revolver it requires the expenditure of one of the character's available attacks.
_<br>[Tab][Tab]-<u>Single-barrel One-Shot Firearm</u>: For a single-barreled muzzleloader or breechloader, the jam must be cleared before the weapon can be used again.
_<br>[Tab][Tab]-<u>Double-barrel Firearm</u>: For a muzzleloader or breechloader, the jammed barrel cannot be used again until the jam is cleared. The remaining barrel can still be loaded and fired as normal.
_<br>[Tab][Tab]-<u>Repeating Rifle or Shotgun</u>: The breech must be cleared before the weapon may be fired again. 
_<br>[Tab][Tab]-<u>Gatling Gun</u>: The jam must be cleared before the weapon can be fired again.
_<br><br>{Color~Red,<u>Failure by 5+</u>:} <b>Minor Mishap.</b> Weapon fails to fire and is damaged in the process. (1d4 or GM's choice).
_<br>[Tab]<b>Damage to weapon:</b> x2 the normal weapon's damage. The weapon cannot be used again until repaired. Even if the weapon didn't suffer damage (due to its hardness), repairing the weapon is considered a complex task.
_<br>[Tab]1- <i>Mechanical Failure:</i> A spring, pin, roller, or other critical component breaks. The ammunition is unspent, but the weapon is no longer functional.
_<br>[Tab]2- <i>Misaligned Cylinder:</i> The cylinder doesn't lock into place correctly and the bullet doesn't enter the barrel cleanly.
_<br>[Tab]3- <i>Over fire:</i> The charge of powder exploded with a force too large for the breech or barrel to hold and the weapon is damaged.
_<br>[Tab]4- <i>Under fire:</i> The bullet fails to escape the barrel and becomes lodged.
_<br><br>{Color~Red,<u>Failure by 10+</u>:} <b>Major Mishap.</b> Weapon doesn't fire and a catastrophic failure ensues. (1d2 or GM's choice).
_<br>[Tab]<b>Damage to weapon:</b> weapon destroyed. Characters and unattended objects (5' radius) take ballistic dmg (x2 normal weapon's dmg; Reflex ½ DC12).
_<br>[Tab]1- <i>Chainfire:</i> If the weapon is a percussion weapon with a revolving breech (or a percussion multi-barreled breechloader or muzzleloader) the ignition of one chamber sparks the other chambers as well, leading to the uncontrolled simultaneous firing of all remaining ammunition.
_<br>[Tab]2- <i>Explosion:</i> A metallurgical failure occurs and the chamber blows out, launching shrapnel in an area around the shooter.
