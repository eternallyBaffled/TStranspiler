:Start
1,<i>Bite:</i> slashing, blunt, and piercing (choose one of the 3 effects).<br>
_<i>Claw / Rake:</i> blunt and piercing (choose on of the 2 effects).<br>
_<i>Gore:</i> piercing.<br>
_<i>Slap / Slam:</i> blunt.<br>
_<i>Sting:</i> piercing.<br>
_<i>Tentacle:</i> blunt (sometimes slashing).<br><br>
_<hr><br><b>Slashing:</b> [~Slashing]
_<br><b>Blunt:</b> [~Blunt]
_<br><b>Piercing:</b> [~Piercing]
_<br><b>Magic:</b> [~Magic]
_<br><br><b><i>Fumble:</b></i> [~Fumble]
_<br><b><i>Fumble, Magical:</b></i> [~FumbleMagic]
_<br><br><hr><u>Prone Condition</u>: The character is on the ground. -4 AC vs melee attacks, +4 AC vs ranged attacks.
_<br><u>Prone and Stunned Condition</u>: (As above) Drop everything held, can't take actions, -2 penalty to AC (total -6 vs melee; +2 vs ranged), and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any).
_<br>*<u>Shield/Helmet destroyed</u>: the item is destroyed but you don't suffer the effect of the critical hit.
_<br><hr><br><b><u>Critical Hit:</b></u><br>
_A threat is made as per the normal rules from the <i>Player's Handbook</i>. If the threat roll hits the target again, a critical hit is scored and the attacker rolls 1d100 in the appropriate table: blunt, piercing, or slashing.<br>
_<u>Optional Rule</u>: If, on the threat roll, the attacker hits the target and gets another threat, he must roll again for an extra critical hit. If this second threat hits the target, the critical hit is much better, and the damage are multiplied by x2 (as per the rules, if it was x2 it becomes x3). The attacker continues like this as long as he gets a threat and hits the target with the threat. Roll only once in the critical hit table.<br><br>
_<b><u>Critical Hits: Special Effects</b></u> (-2 penalties)<br>
_<b>Arm:</b> Climb and Swim; attack rolls and Strength.<br>
_<b>Hand:</b> Alchemy, Climb, Craft, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Forgery, Heal, Open Lock, Pick Pocket, and Use Rope; attack rolls.<br>
_<b>Eye (1):</b> Appraise, Alchemy, Craft, Decipher Script, Disable Device, Forgery, Open Lock, Read Lips, Scry, Search, Sense Motive, Spellcraft, Spot, Wilderness Lore (track only); initiative; Dex checks; Reflex saves. Blind if both eyes.<br>
_<b>Ear (1):</b> Listen; initiative. Deaf if both ears.<br>
_<b>Feet/Leg:</b> Balance, Climb, Jump, Move Silently, Ride, Swim, Tumble; Dex checks, Reflex saves.<br>
_<b>Head:</b> Attack rolls, all saving throws, all other checks.<br><br>
_<b>Example</b>: If the "Primary arm (weapon) struck" critical hit is rolled, the target suffers a -2 penalty on its attack rolls, Climb and Swim checks, and its Strength score.<br><br>
_<u>Until Healed</u>: all the damage received from a critical hit must be healed to prevent the special effects of this critical hit. (Example: For the "Chest injuries (death in 2d4 rounds)" critical hit, all damage from this critical hit must be healed or death will happen in 2d4 rounds, even if only 1 hit point was not restored.)"<br><br>
_<b><u>Fumble:</b></u><br>
_A <i>fumble</i> is obtained when a natural "1" si rolled on any attack roll. This has 2 effects:<br>
_1- All attacks after the "1", in the same action (not for AoO made later in the round), are cancelled. So, a "1" on an AoO cancels only this AoO.<br>
_2- The attacker rolls 1d100 in the fumble table and suffers the consequences.<br><br>
_Note: if the critical hit or the fumble result rolled does not apply (ex: the target does not have a shield), the critical hit is made normally or there is no other effects from the fumble, except losing the attacks after the "1".<br>
