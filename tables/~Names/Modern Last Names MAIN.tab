# Normal (Modern 2002) Name Generator
# Assembled by Anthony Pham - rocketturtle@pex.net

# Not all human players come from far away galaxies or magical kindgoms.
# For humans from good old Earth (or something similar) here is set of tables
# that will generate random names of the current modern era (as of AD 2002 
# anyway).
#
# Be careful when generating last names, there are quite a few
# entries so there will be a noticible slowdown while Tablesmith
# accesses them.  So if you only need a first name, just use the
# First name scripts.
#
# These name lists were taken from the US Census
# First filtered through:
# http://www.kleimo.com/random/name.cfm
#
# I'm assuming this is public property, however any lawyers out 
# there please let me know if I'm breaking the law so I can
# pull these from the downloads section.
#
# Modified by Valminder, Nov 2003.
#    I created this Main Table from "Last Names.tab" and divided 
#    "Last Names.tab" in many smaller tables called
#    "Modern Last Names X.tab" to try to make it faster to roll.
