01-05, Congratulations! It’s a bleeder in your primary arm! Take 1 damage from endurance immediately and 1 per pulse thereafter until the flow is staunched by a healer, hospitaler, or ranger of appropriate rank. If the bleeding is not stopped you will die.
06-07, Oh no! Your opponent’s weapon has entered your secondary arm’s elbow joint and the tip has broken off. Take 2 damage points immediately to endurance and that arm is useless until the sliver is removed by a healer of rank 3 of higher. Chance of infection is increased by 30%.
08,A vicious puncture wound to the groin! Take 3 damage points to endurance and reduce your TMR by 2 until fully recovered, which will take about 2 months. In additional, add 30% to your chance of being infected. (Assuming you live long enough for such things to matter.)
09-10,You have been stabbed in your secondary arm. Drop whatever you were holding in it and take 2 damage points immediately from endurance. It will take a full week for the arm to be useful to you whatsoever.
11,Your aorta is severed and you are quite dead. Rest assured your companions will do their best to comfort your widow (er).
12,A stomach puncture. Nasty. You suffer 3 damage points to endurance and loose 2 from TMR until fully recovered, which will take about two months. Also you are automatically stunned for the next pulse after which you will recover. Add 20% to being infected.
13,Your opponent’s weapon has entered your eye: roll D10 (<b>{Dice~1d10}</b>). On a roll of 1, the weapon has entered your brain and you are dead. On a roll of 2-5, your left eye is blinded; on a roll of 6–10, your right eye is blinded. If you are lucky enough to be blinded instead of killed, you have suffered 2 damage points to endurance.  In addition, a person who is blinded suffers the following subtractions: -2 to physical beauty, -4 from perception; -1 from dexterity.  A figure blinded in one eye reduces his base chance with missile or thrown weapons by 30%.
14-18,Tsk, Tsk. A wound to the solid viscera. Usually fatal. Take 3 damage points to endurance immediately and 1 per pulse thereafter until the bleeding is stopped by a healer of rank 2 or above or you die. Add 30% to the base chance of an infection.
19-20,Take a stab in the leg (your choice as to which one) resulting in a deep puncture of the thigh muscle. Suffer 1 damage point to endurance immediately and reduce your TMR by 1 until you heal which will take four weeks.
21-25,A chest wound. Take 2 damage ponts to endurance and reduce your TMR by 1 until recovered (about 2 months). Look on the bright side,  though. Your attacker’s weapons is caught in your rib cage and has been wrenched from his grasp.
26-27, Bad luck! Your secondary hand has been severed at the wrist. Take two damage points endurance and subtract 1 per pulse from fatigue thereafter (endurance when fatigue is exhausted) until you are dead or the bleeding is staunched by a healer of rank 2 or above. If you live your manual dexterity is reduced by 2. 
28-30,Worse luck! Your primary hand has been severed at the wrist. Take two damage points endurance and subtract 1 per pulse from fatigue thereafter (endurance when fatigue is exhausted) until you are dead or the bleeding is staunched by a healer of rank 2 or above. If you live your manual dexterity is reduced by 2.
31-34,A minor wound. You face is slashed open ruining your boyish good looks and causing blood to spurt into your eyes. Reduce your physical beauty by 4 permanently unless you have the wound treated by a healer of rank 4 or higher.
35,Your secondary arm is sliced off at the shoulder. Take 5 damage points to endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter from fatigue, endurance when  fatigue is exhausted until you are dead or the bleeding is stopped by a healer or rank 2 or higher. Reduce your manual dexterity by 2 and  your agility by 1.
36,Your primary arm is sliced off at the shoulder. Take 5 damage points to endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter from fatigue, endurance when  fatigue is exhausted until you are dead or the bleeding is stopped by a healer or rank 2 or higher. Reduce your manual dexterity by 2 and  your agility by 1.
37-40,You have been eviscerated! Take 4 damage points to endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter (endurance when fatigue is exhausted ) until you are unconscious or the bleeding is stopped by a healer of rank 2 or higher. Increase your chance of infection by 40%.
41-42,A glancing blow lays open your scalp and severs one ear (your choice as to which one). Take 2 damage points to endurance and reduce your perception by 1 and physical beauty by 2. If you are a member of a race that primarily relies on hearing your perception is reduced by 5.
43,A savage slash rips open your cheek and jaw. Next pulse you are stunned (if you aren’t already stunned from the damage). Your physical beauty is increased by 1 because your wound brings out the maternal/paternal instincts in the opposite gender.
44-50,A slash along your primary arm, and it’s a bleeder. Take 2 damage points to endurance and lose 1 fatigue per pulse and endurance when that is exhausted until the bleeding is stopped by a rank 2 healer or you die.
51-52,Hamstrung! Roll D10 (<b>{Dice~1d10}</b>). On a roll of 1-4 it is your left leg, on a roll of 5-10 it is your right leg. Take 4 damage to endurance and fall prone. You may not stand unassisted until the wound is healed by a healer or 3 months of recovery. Your agility is reduced by 3.
53-60,Your primary arm is crippled by a wicked slash! Take 2 damage points to endurance and drop anything you have in your primary arm. The arm is unusable until healed by a healer or 3 months of recovery.

The arm will be unusable for 3 months.
70-74,A crushing blow smashes your helmet and causes a concussion. Take 3 damage points to endurance and reduce your agility and manual dexterity by 4 for 3 days. 
75-80,A massive chest wound accompanied by broken ribs and crushed tissues. Very ugly, this. Take 5 damage points to endurance and reduce dexterity and agility by 3 until this wound heals in about 4 months. Increase you chance of infection by 10%.
81-84,A crushing blow smashes tissues and produces internal injuries. Take 2 damage points to endurance and 1 per pulse thereafter to fatigue (endurance when fatigue is gone) until unconscious or you receive the attention of a healer of rank 2 or higher.
85-87,A jarring blow to your primary shoulder inflicts 2 points of damage to endurance and causes you to drop anything held in that hand. You will be unable to use the blow for D10 (<b>{Dice~1d10}</b>) pulses. (Assuming you don’t die).

95-97,Your opponents weapon comes crashing down on your head and fractures your skull. You fall prone and are unconscious and take 8 damage points to endurance. IF you survive reduce your agility, dexterity and perception by 2. It will take a year to recover in bed from this injury.
98-100,A crushing blow shatters your pelvis. Take 7 damage points to endurance and fall prone. Try to roll under your willpower on D100 (<b>{Dice~1d100}</b>) to avoid going unconscious.  If you survive you will be unable to move for D10 (<b>{Dice~1d10}</b>) months.
