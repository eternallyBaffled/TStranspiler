The tables that have been developed are provided free of charge.

I have developed these treasure tables based on 2ed which is what I play.  Also, I have added various Forgotten Realms information for local color.  Since these files are pretty much seperate, They should be fairly easy to modify for other worlds or settings.

For Specific Magic Items the table generates a code;
   Examples:
	D-104A-12-x = A Cube of Frost Resistance
	D-108A-10-7 = A (+1) dagger
	D-105-10-2 = Plate mail (-1)
   The code is fairly strait forward
    First is book, where D=DMG (the only one I have put in so far)
    Second is table ID
    Third & fourth are die roll. Where x=no roll required.
  As a DM I use this code to identify magic items by giving
     it to the players instead of the details.

Additionaly, I have placed them in a subdirectory called FR_2ED_TREAS.  When unzipped this should be a subdirectory within the default \TABLES directory.  I felt this helped organize the various tables that I use with TableSmith.

Future plans;
-  The art table is still  a little rough.  I am working on improvements, It is funtional, but it still incomplete in my opinion.
-  Some day I hope to incorporate the treasure tables from the Unearthed arcana.  Unfortunately, I have not typed in those tables yet.



The following files are included.
